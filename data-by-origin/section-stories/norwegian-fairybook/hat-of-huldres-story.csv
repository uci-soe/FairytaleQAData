1,"Once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead, and a
certain cottager was on his way to the wedding-feast. As he chanced to
cross a field, he found a milk-strainer, such as are usually made of
cows' tails, and looking just like an old brown rag. He picked it up,
for he thought it could be washed, and then he would give it to his
wife for a dish-rag. But when he came to the house where they were
celebrating the wedding, it seemed as though no one saw him. The bride
and groom nodded to the rest of the guests, they spoke to them and
poured for them; but he got neither greeting nor drink. Then the chief
cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table; but he was
not asked, nor did he get anything to eat. For he did not care to sit
down of his own accord when no one had asked him. At last he grew angry
and thought: ""I might as well go home, for not a soul pays a bit of
attention to me here."" When he reached home, he said: ""Good evening,
here I am back again."""
2,"""For heaven's sake, are you back again?"" asked his wife.

""Yes, there was no one there who paid any attention to me, or even so
much as looked at me,"" said the man, ""and when people show me so little
consideration, it seems as though I have nothing to look for there.""

""But where are you? I can hear you, but I cannot see you!"" cried his
wife."
3,"The man was invisible, for what he had found was a huldre hat.

""What are you talking about? Can't you see me? Have you lost your wits?""
asked the man. ""There is an old hair strainer for you. I found it
outside on the ground,"" said he, and he threw it on the bench. And
then his wife saw him; but at the same moment the hat of the huldres
disappeared, for he should only have loaned it, not given it away.
Now the man saw how everything had come about, and went back to the
wedding-feast. And this time he was received in right friendly fashion,
and was asked to drink, and to seat himself at the table."
