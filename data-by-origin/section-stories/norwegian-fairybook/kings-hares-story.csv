1,"Once upon a time there was a man who lived in the little back room. He
had given up his estate to the heir. But in addition he had three sons,
who were named Peter, Paul and Esben, who was the youngest. All three
hung around at home and would not work, for they had it too easy.
They thought themselves too good for anything like work, and nothing was good enough for them. Finally Peter once heard that the king wanted a shepherd for his hares, and he told his father he would apply for the
position, as it would just suit him, seeing that he wished to serve no
one lower in rank than the king. His father, it is true, was of the
opinion that there might be other work that would suit him better, for
whoever was to herd hares would have to be quick and spry, and not a
sleepy-head. When the hares took to their heels in all directions,
it was a dance of another kind than when one skipped about a room. But
it was of no use. Peter insisted, and would have his own way, took his
knapsack, and shambled down hill. After he had gone a while, he saw an
old woman who had got her nose wedged in a tree-stump while chopping
wood, and when Peter saw her jerking and pulling away, trying to get
out, he burst into loud laughter."
2,"""Don't stand there and laugh in such a stupid way,"" said the woman,
""but come and help a poor, feeble old woman. I wanted to split up some
fire-wood, and caught my nose here. Here I have been standing for
more than a hundred years, pulling and jerking, without a bit of bread
to chew in all that time,"" said she.

Then Peter had to laugh all the harder. He found it all very amusing,
and said that if she had already been standing there a hundred years,
then she could probably hold out for another hundred years or more."
3,"When he came to court they at once took him on as a herdsman. The place was not bad, there was good food, and good wages, and the chance of winning the princess besides. Yet if no more than a single one of the
king's hares were to be lost, they would cut three red strips from his
back, and throw him into the snake-pit.

As long as Peter was on the common or in the enclosure, he kept his
hares together nicely, but later, when they reached the forest, they ran
away from him across the hills. Peter ran after them with tremendous
leaps, as long as he thought he could catch even a single hare, but when
the very last one had vanished, his breath was gone, and he saw no more
of them. Toward noon he went home, taking his time about it, and when he
reached the enclosure, he looked around for them on all sides, but no
hares came. And then, when he came to the castle, there stood the king
with the knife in his hand. He cut three red strips from his back, and
cast him into the snake-pit."
4,"After a while Paul decided to go to the castle and herd the king's
hares. His father told him what he had told Peter, and more besides. But
he insisted on going, and would not listen, and he fared neither better
nor worse than Peter had. The old woman stood and pulled and jerked at
her nose in the tree-trunk, and he laughed, found it very amusing, and
let her stand there and torment herself. He was at once taken into
service, but the hares all ran away across the hills, though he pursued
them, and worked away like a shepherd dog in the sun, and when he came
back to the castle in the evening minus his hares, there stood the king
with the knife in his hand, cut three broad strips from his back, rubbed
in pepper and salt, and flung him into the snake-pit."
5,"Then, after some time had passed, the youngest decided to set out to
herd the king's hares, and told his father of his intention. He thought
that would be just the work for him, to loaf about in forest and field,
look for strawberry patches, herd a flock of hares, and lie down and
sleep in the sun between times. His father thought that there was other
work that would suit him better, and that even if he fared no worse than
his brothers, it was quite certain that he would fare no better. Whoever
herded the king's hares must not drag along as though he had lead in
his soles, or like a fly on a limerod. And that when the hares took to
their heels, it was a horse of another color from catching flees with
gloved hands. Whoever wanted to escape with a whole back, would have to
be more than quick and nimble, and swifter than a bird. But there was
nothing he could do. Esben merely kept on saying that he wanted to go to
court and serve the king, for he would not take service with any lesser
master, said he. And he would see to the hares, they could not be much
worse than a herd of goats or of calves. And with that he took his
knapsack and strolled comfortably down the hill."
6,"After he had wandered a while, and began to feel a proper hunger, he
came to the old woman who was wedged by the nose in the tree-trunk and
who was pulling and jerking away, in order to get loose.

""Good day, mother,"" said Esben, ""and why are you worrying yourself so
with your nose, you poor thing?"" ""No one has called me mother for the
last hundred years,"" said the old woman, ""but come and help me out, and
give me a bite to eat; for I have not had a bit to eat in all that time.
And I will do something for your sake as well,"" said she.

Yes, no doubt she would need something to eat and drink badly, said
Esben.

Then he hewed the tree-trunk apart, so that she got her nose out of the
cleft, sat down to eat, and shared with her. The old woman had a good
appetite, and she received a good half of his provisions."
7,"When they were through she gave Esben a whistle which had the power that if he blew into one end, whatever he wished scattered was scattered to all the winds, and when he blew into the other, all came together again. And if the whistle passed from his possession, it would return as soon as he wished it back.

""That is a wonderful whistle!"" thought Esben."
8,"When he came to the castle, they at once took him on as a shepherd. The
place was not bad, he was to have food and wages, and should he manage
to herd the king's hares without losing one of them, he might possibly
win the princess. But if he lost so much as a single hare, and no matter
how small it might be, then they would cut three red strips from his
back, and the king was so sure of his case that he went right off to
whet his knife. It would be a simple matter to herd the hares, thought
Esben. For when they went off they were as obedient as a herd of sheep,
and so long as they were on the common, and in the enclosure, they
even marched in rank and file. But when they reached the forest, and
noon-time came, and the sun burned down on hill and dale, they all took
to their heels and ran away across the hills."
9,"""Hallo, there! So you want to run away!"" called Esben, and blew into one
end of his whistle, and then they scattered the more quickly to all the
ends of the earth. But when he had reached an old charcoal-pit, he blew
into the other end of his whistle, and before he knew it the hares were
back again, and standing in rank and file so he could review them, just
like a regiment of soldiers on the drill-ground.

""That is a splendid whistle!"" thought Esben; lay down on a sunny
hillock, and fell asleep. The hares were left to their own devices, and
played until evening. Then he once more whistled them together, and took
them along to the castle like a herd of sheep."
10,"The king and queen and the princess, too, stood in the hall-way, and
wondered what sort of a fellow this was, who could herd hares without
losing a single one. The king reckoned and added them up, and counted
with his fingers, and then added them up again; but not even the
teeny-weeniest hare was missing. ""He is quite a chap, he is,"" said the
princess.

The following day he again went to the forest, and herded his hares. But
while he lay in all comfort beside a strawberry patch, they sent out the
chamber-maid from the castle to him, and she was to find out how he
managed to herd the king's hares."
11,"He showed her his whistle, and blew into one end, and all the hares
darted away across the hills in all directions, and then he blew into
the other, and they came trotting up from all sides, and once more stood
in rank and file. ""That is a wonderful whistle,"" said the chamber-maid.
She would gladly give him a hundred dollars, if he cared to sell it.

""Yes, it is a splendid whistle,"" said Esben, ""and I will not sell it for
money. But if you give me a hundred dollars, and a kiss with every
dollar to boot, then I might let you have it.""

Yes, indeed, that would suit her right down to the ground; she would
gladly give him two kisses with every dollar, and feel grateful,
besides."
12,"So she got the whistle, but when she reached the castle, the whistle
disappeared all of a sudden. Esben had wished it back again, and toward
evening he came along, driving his hares like a herd of sheep. The king
reckoned and counted and added, but all to no purpose, for not the least
little hare was missing.

When Esben was herding his hares the third day, they sent the princess
to him to get away his pipe from him. She was tickled to death, and
finally offered him two hundred dollars if he would let her have the
whistle, and would also tell her what she had to do in order to fetch it
safely home with her."
13,"""Yes, it is a very valuable whistle,"" said Esben, ""and I will not sell
it,"" but at last, as a favor to her, he said he would let her have it if
she gave him two hundred dollars, and a kiss for every dollar to boot.
But if she wanted to keep it, why, she must take good care of it, for
that was her affair.

""That is a very high price for a hare-whistle,"" said the princess, and
she really shrank from kissing him, ""but since we are here in the middle
of the forest, where no one can see or hear us, I'll let it pass, for I
positively must have the whistle,"" said she. And when Esben had pocketed
the price agreed upon, she received the whistle, and held it tightly
clutched in her hand all the way home; yet when she reached the castle,
and wanted to show it, it disappeared out of her hands. On the following
day the queen herself set out, and she felt quite sure that she would
succeed in coaxing the whistle away from him."
14,"She was stingier, and only offered fifty dollars; but she had to raise
her bid until she reached three hundred. Esben said it was a magnificent
whistle, and that the price was a beggarly one; but seeing that she
was the queen, he would let it pass. She was to pay him three hundred
dollars, and for every dollar she was to give him a buss to boot, then
she should have the whistle. And he was paid in full as agreed, since as
regards the busses the queen was not so stingy.

When she had the whistle in her hands, she tied it fast, and hid it
well, but she fared not a whit better than either of the others. When
she wanted to show the whistle it was gone, and in the evening Esben
came home, driving his hares as though they were a well-trained flock of
sheep."
15,"""You are stupid women!"" said the king. ""I suppose I will have to go to
him myself if we really are to obtain this trumpery whistle. There seems
to be nothing else left to do!"" And the following day, when Esben was
once more herding his hares, the king followed him, and found him at the
same place where the women had bargained with him.

They soon became good friends, and Esben showed him the whistle, and
blew into one end and the other, and the king thought the whistle very
pretty, and finally insisted on buying it, even though it cost him a
thousand dollars."
16,"""Yes, it is a magnificent whistle,"" said Esben, ""and I would not sell it
for money. But do you see that white mare over yonder?"" said he, and
pointed into the forest.

""Yes, she belongs to me, that is my Snow Witch!"" cried the king, for he
knew her very well.

""Well, if you will give me a thousand dollars, and kiss the white mare
that is grazing on the moor by the big pine, to boot, then you can have
my whistle!"" said Esben.

""Is that the only price at which you will sell?"" asked the king.

""Yes,"" said Esben.

""But at least may I not put a silken handkerchief between?"" asked the
king."
17,"This was conceded him, and thus he obtained the whistle. He put it in
the purse in his pocket, and carefully buttoned up the pocket. Yet when
he reached the castle, and wanted to take it out, he was in the same
case as the women, for he no longer had the whistle. And in the evening
Esben came home with his herd of hares, and not the least little hare
was missing.

The king was angry, and furious because he had made a fool of them all,
and had swindled the king's self out of the whistle into the bargain,
and now he wanted to do away with Esben. The queen was of the same
opinion, and said it was best to behead such a knave when he was caught
in the act."
18,"Esben thought this neither fair nor just; for he had only done what he
had been asked to do, and had defended himself as best he knew how.

But the king said that this made no difference to him; yet if Esben
could manage to fill the big brewing-cauldron till it ran over, he would
spare his life.

The job would be neither long nor hard, said Esben, he thought he could
warrant that, and he began to tell about the old woman with her nose
in the tree-trunk, and in between he said, ""I must make up plenty of
stories, to fill the cauldron,""--and then he told of the whistle, and
the chamber-maid who came to him and wanted to buy the whistle for a
hundred dollars, and about all the kisses that she had had to give him
to boot, up on the hillock by the forest; and then he told about the
princess, how she had come and kissed him so sweetly for the whistle's
sake, because no one could see or hear it in the forest--""I must make up
plenty of stories, in order to fill the cauldron,"" said Esben. Then he
told of the queen, and of how stingy she had been with her money, and
how liberal with her busses--""for I must make up plenty of stories in
order to fill the cauldron,"" said Esben."
19,"""But I think it must be full now!"" said the queen.

""O, not a sign of it!"" said the king.

Then Esben began to tell how the king had come to him, and about the
white mare who was grazing on the moor, ""and since he insisted on having
the whistle he had to--he had to--well, with all due respect, I have to
make up plenty of stories in order to fill the cauldron,"" said Esben.

""Stop, stop! It is full, fellow!"" cried the king. ""Can't you see that it
is running over?""

The king and the queen were of the opinion that it would be best for
Esben to receive the princess and half the kingdom; there did not seem
anything else to do.

""Yes, it was a magnificent whistle!"" said Esben."
