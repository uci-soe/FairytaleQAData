1,"Once upon a time there was a woman who had a son. He was so lazy and slow that there was not a single blessed useful thing he would do. But
he liked to sing and to dance, and that is what he did all day long, and
far into the night as well. The longer this went on, the worse off his
mother was. The youth was growing, and he wanted so much to eat that it
was barely possible to find it. More and more went for his clothes
the older he grew, since his clothes did not last long, as you may
imagine, because the youth skipped and dance about without stopping,
through forest and field.

At length it was too much for his mother. One day she told the young
fellow that he ought at last to get to work, and really do something, or
both of them would have to starve to death. But the youth had no mind to
do so, he said, and would rather try to win the daughter of the mother
in the corner. If he got her, then he would live happily ever after,
and could sing and dance, and would not have to plague himself with
work."
2,"When the mother heard that she thought it might not be such a bad idea
after all. She dressed up the youth as well as she could, so that
he would make a good showing when he came to the mother in the corner,
and then he set forth.

When he stepped out the sun was shining bright and warm. It had
rained during the night, and the ground was soft and full of water
puddles. The youth took the shortest path to the mother in the corner,
and sang and danced, as he always did. But suddenly, as he was hopping
and skipping along, he came to a swamp, and there were only some logs
laid down to cross it. From the one log he had to jump over a puddle
to a clump of grass, unless he wanted to dirty his shoes. And then he
went kerflop! The very moment he set foot on the clump of grass, he went
down and down until he was standing in a dark, ugly hole. At first he
could see nothing at all, but when he had been there a little while, he
saw that there was a rat, who was wiggling and waggling around, and had
a bunch of keys hanging from her tail."
3,"""Have you come, my boy?"" said the rat. ""I must thank you for coming to
visit me: I have been expecting you for a long time. I am sure you have
come to win me, and I can well imagine that you are in a great hurry.
But you must have a little patience. I am to receive a large dower, and
am not yet ready for the wedding. I will do my best to see that we
are married soon.""

When she had said this, she produced a couple of egg-shells, with all
sorts of eatables such as rats eat. She set them down before the youth,
and said: ""Now you must sit down and help yourself, for I am sure you
are tired and hungry."""
4,"The youth had no great appetite for this food. ""If I were only away and
up above again,"" thought he, but he said nothing.

""Now I think you must surely want to get home again,"" said the rat. ""I
am well aware that you are waiting impatiently for the wedding, and I
will hurry all I can. Take this linen thread along, and when you get up
above, you must not turn around, but must go straight home, and as you
go you must keep repeating: 'Short before and long behind!'"" and with
that she laid a linen thread in his hand.

""Heaven be praised!"" said the youth when he was up above once more.
""I'll not go down there again in a hurry."" But he held the thread in his
hand, and danced and sang as usual. And although he no longer had the
rat-hole in mind, he began to hum:

      ""Short before and long behind!
      Short before and long behind!"""
5,"When he stood before the door at home, he turned around; and there lay
many, many hundred yards of the finest linen, finer than the most
skillful weaver could have spun.

""Mother, come out, come out!"" called and cried the youth. His mother
came darting out, and asked what was the matter. And when she saw the
linen, stretching as far as she could see, and then a bit, she could
not believe her eyes, until the youth told her how it all happened. But
when she had heard that, and had tested the linen between her fingers,
she was so pleased that she, too, began to sing and dance.

Then she took the linen, cut it, and sewed shirts from it for her son
and herself. The remainder she took to town and sold for a good
price. Then for a time they lived in all joy and comfort. But when that
was over the woman had not a bite to eat in the house. She told
her son that it was the highest time for him to take service, and really
do something, or else both of them would have to starve to death."
6,"But the youth preferred to go to the mother in the corner, and try to
win her daughter. His mother did not think this such a bad idea, for now
the youth was handsomely dressed, and made a good showing.

So she brushed him, and furbished him up as well as she could. He
himself took a pair of new shoes, and polished them till they shone like
a mirror, and when he had done so, off he went. Everything happened as
before. When he stepped out, the sun was shining bright and warm. It
had rained during the night, and the road was soft and muddy, and every
puddle was full of water. The youth took the shortest way to the mother
in the corner, and sang and danced and danced and sang, as he always
did. He followed another road, not the one he had taken before; but as
he was hopping and skipping along, he suddenly came to the log across
the swamp, and from the log he had to jump over a puddle to a clump of
grass, unless he wanted to dirty his shoes. And then he went kerflop.
And he sank down and could not stop, until he reached a horrible, dark,
ugly hole. At first he could see nothing; but after he had stood there a
while, he discovered a rat with a bunch of keys at the end of her tail,
which she was wiggling and waggling in front of him."
7,"""Have you come, my boy?"" said the rat. ""You are welcome among us! It was kind of you to come and visit me again so soon. No doubt you are very
impatient, I can well imagine it. But you must really be patient a little while longer. My trousseau is not quite complete, but by the time you come again all shall be ready."" When she had said this she offered him egg-shells containing all sorts of food such as rats like. But it looked to the youth like food that had been eaten, and he said that he had no appetite. ""If I were only safely away, and up above again,"" thought he, but he said nothing. After a time the rat said: ""Now I think you must surely want to get up above again. I will hurry on the wedding as quickly as I can. And now take this woolen thread along, and when you get up above, you must not turn around, but go straight home, and underway you must keep on repeating: 'Short before and long behind!'"" and with that she laid the woolen thread in his hand."
8,"""Thank heaven, I have escaped!"" said the youth to himself. ""I am sure
I'll never go there again,"" and then he sang and danced again as usual.
He thought no more of the rat-hole, but fell to humming, and sang
without stopping:

      ""Short before and long behind!
      Short before and long behind!""

When he stood at the door of the house, he happened to look around.
There lay the finest woolen goods, many hundred yards of it, stretching
for half a mile, and so fine that no city counselor wore a coat of finer
cloth."
9,"""Mother, mother, come out, come out!"" cried the youth. His mother came
to the door, clasped her hands together over her head, and nearly
fainted with joy when she saw all the fine goods. And then the youth had
to tell her how it had come to him, and all that had taken place, from
beginning to end. This brought them a small fortune, as you may imagine.
The youth had new clothes, and his mother went to town and sold the
goods, yard by yard, and was handsomely paid for them. And then she
decorated her room, and she herself, in her old days, went about in such
style that she might have been taken for some lady of distinction. So
they lived splendidly and happily, but finally this money, too, came to
an end. One day the woman had not a bite to eat left in the house,
and told her son that now he had better look for work, and really do
something, or both of them would starve to death."
10,"But the youth thought it would be much better to go to the mother in the
corner and try to win her daughter. This time his mother again agreed
with him, and did not contradict the youth. Now he had fine new
clothes, and looked so distinguished that it seemed out of the question
to her that such a good-looking fellow would be refused. So she
furbished him up and tricked him out in the handsomest way, and he
himself took out his new shoes and polished them so brightly that you
could see yourself in them, and when he had done so he set forth.

This time he did not choose the shortest road. He took a roundabout
way, the longest he could find, for he did not want to go down to the
rat again because he was sick of her eternal wiggling and waggling, and
the talk about marriage. The weather and the road were exactly the same
as when he had gone before. The sun shone, the swamp and the puddles
gleamed, and the youth sang and danced as usual. And in the midst of his
skipping and jumping, before he knew it, there he stood at the same
crossing which led across the swamp. There he had to jump over a puddle
to a clump of grass, unless he wanted to dirty his brightly polished
shoes. ""Kerflop!"" and down he went, and did not stop until he stood once
more in the same dark, ugly, dirty hole. At first he was pleased because
he could see nothing. But after he had stood there a while, he once more
discovered the ugly rat who was so repulsive to him, with the bunch of
keys hanging from her tail."
11,"""Good-day, my boy,"" said the rat. ""You are welcome! I see that you can
no longer live without me, and I thank you. And now everything is in
readiness for our wedding, and we will go straight to church."" Nothing
will come of that, thought the youth, but he did not say a word. Then
the rat whistled, and at once every corner was alive with swarms of mice
and small rats, and six large rats came dragging along a frying-pan. Two
mice sat up behind as grooms, and two sprang up in front to drive the
coach. Several seated themselves within, and the rat with the bunch of
keys took her place in their midst. To the youth she said: ""The road
is a little narrow here, so you will have to walk beside the coach,
sweetheart, until the road is broader. And then you may sit beside me in
the coach.""

""How fine that will be!"" thought the youth. ""If I were only safely up
above once more, I would run away from the whole pack of them,"" thought
he, but he said nothing. He went along with the procession as well as he
could. At times he had to crawl, at others he had to stoop, for the way
was very narrow. But when it grew better, he walked in advance, and
looked about to see how he might most easily steal away and make off.
And then he suddenly heard a clear, beautiful voice behind him say: ""Now
the road is good! Come, sweetheart, and get into the coach!"""
12,"The youth turned around quickly, and was so astonished that his nose and
ears nearly fell off. There stood a magnificent coach with six white
horses, and in the coach sat a maiden as fair and beautiful as the sun,
and about her were sitting others, as bright and kindly as the stars. It
was a princess and her playmates, who had all been enchanted together.
But now they were delivered, because he had come down to them, and had never contradicted.

""Come along now!"" said the princess. Then the youth got into the coach,
and drove to church with her. And when they drove away from the church,
the princess said: ""Now we will first drive to my home, and then we will
send for your mother."""
13,"""That's all very fine,"" thought the youth--he said nothing, but he
thought it would be better, after all, to drive to his home, instead of
down into the hideous rat-hole. But suddenly they came to a beautiful
castle, and there they turned in, for there it was they were to live.
And at once a fine coach with six horses was sent for the youth's
mother, and when she came the wedding festivities began. They celebrated for fourteen days, and perhaps they are celebrating yet. We must hurry, and perhaps we may still get there in time, and can drink the groom's health and dance with the bride!"
