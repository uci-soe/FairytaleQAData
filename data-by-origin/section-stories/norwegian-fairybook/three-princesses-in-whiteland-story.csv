1,"Once upon a time there was a fisherman, who lived near the king's
castle, and caught fish for the king's table. One day when he had gone
fishing, he could not catch a thing. Try as he might, no matter how he
baited or flung, not the tiniest fish would bite; but when this had gone
on for a while, a head rose from the water and said: ""If you will give
me the first new thing that has come into your house, you shall catch
fish a-plenty!"" Then the man agreed quickly, for he could think of no
new thing that might have come into the house. So he caught fish all day
long, and as many as he could wish for, as may well be imagined."
2,"But when he got home, he found that heaven had sent him a little son, the
first new thing to come into the house since he had made his promise.
And when he told his wife about it, she began to weep and wail, and pray
to God because of the vow her husband had made. And the woman's grief
was reported at the castle, and when it came to the king's ears, and he
learned the reason, he promised to take the boy and see if he could not
save him. And so the king took him and brought him up as though he were
his own son, until he was grown. Then one day the boy asked whether he
might not go out fishing with his father, he wanted to so very much,
said he. The king would not hear of it; but at last he was given
permission, so he went to his father, and everything went well all day
long, until they came home in the evening."
3,"Then the son found he had forgotten his handkerchief, and went down to the boat to get it. But no sooner was he in the boat than it moved off with a rush, and no matter how hard the youth worked against it with the oars, it was all in vain. The boat drove on and on, all night long, and at last he came to a white strand, far, far away. He stepped ashore, and after he had gone a while he met an old man with a great, white beard. ""What is this country called?"" asked the youth. ""Whiteland,"" was the man's answer, and he asked the youth where he came from, and what he wanted, and the latter told him. ""If you keep right on along the shore,"" said the man, ""you will come to three princesses, buried in the earth so that only their heads show. Then the first will call you--and she is the oldest--and beg you very hard to come to her and help her; and the next will do the same; but you must go to neither of them; walk quickly past them, and act as though you neither saw nor heard them. But go up to the third, and do what she asks of you, for then you will make your fortune."""
4,"When the youth came to the first princess, she called out to him, and
begged him most earnestly to come to her; but he went on as though he
had not seen her. And he passed the next one in the same manner; but
went over to the third. ""If you will do what I tell you to, you shall
have whichever one of us you want,"" said she. Yes, he would do what she
wanted. So she told him that three trolls had wished them into the earth
where they were; but that formerly they had dwelt in the castle he saw
on the edge of the forest."
5,"""Now you must go to the castle, and let the trolls whip you one night
through for each one of us,"" said she, ""and if you can hold out, you
will have delivered us."" ""Yes,"" said the youth, he could manage that.
""When you go in,"" added the princess, ""you will find two lions standing
by the door; but if you pass directly between them, they will do you no
harm. Go on into a dark little room and lie down, and then the troll
will come and beat you; but after that you must take the bottle that
hangs on the wall, and anoint yourself where he has beaten you, and you
will be whole again. And take the sword that hangs beside the bottle,
and kill the troll with it."" He did as the princess had told him, passed
between the lions as though he did not see them, and right into the
little room, where he lay down. The first night a troll with three heads
and three whips came, and beat the youth badly; but he held out, and
when the troll had finished, he took the bottle and anointed himself,
grasped the sword and killed the troll. When he came out in the morning
the princesses were out of the ground up to their waists. The next night
it was the same; but the troll who came this time had six heads and six
whips, and beat him worse than the first one."
6,"But when he came out in the morning, the princesses were out of the ground up to their ankles. The third night came a troll who had nine heads and nine whips, and he beat and whipped the youth so severely that at last he fainted. Then the troll took him and flung him against the wall, and as he did so the bottle fell down, and its whole contents poured over the youth, and he was at once sound and whole again. Then he did not delay, but grasped the sword, killed the troll, and when he came out in the morning, the princesses were entirely out of the ground. So he chose the youngest of them to be his queen, and lived long with her in peace and happiness.

But at last he was minded to travel home, and see how his parents fared.
This did not suit his queen; but since he wanted to go so badly, and
finally was on the point of departure, she said to him: ""One thing you
must promise me, that you will only do what your father tells you to do,
but not what your mother tells you to do."" And this he promised. Then
she gave him a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the
one who wore it. So he wished himself home, and his parents could not
get over their surprise at seeing how fine and handsome he had become."
7,"When he had been home a few days, his mother wanted him to go up to the
castle and show the king what a man he had grown to be. His father said:
""No, he had better not do that, for we will have to do without him in
the meantime."" But there was no help for it, the mother begged and
pleaded until he went. When he got there he was more splendidly dressed
and fitted out than the other king. This did not suit the latter, and he
said: ""You can see what my queen looks like, but I cannot see yours; and
I do not believe yours is as beautiful as mine."" ""God grant she were
standing here, then you would see soon enough!"" said the young king, and
there she stood that very minute. But she was very sad, and said to him:
""Why did you not follow my advice and listen to your father? Now I must
go straight home, and you have used up both of your wishes."" With that
she bound a ring with her name on it in his hair, and wished herself
home."
8,"Then the young king grew very sad, and went about day in, day out, with
no other thought than getting back to his queen. ""I must try and see
whether I cannot find out where Whiteland is,"" thought he, and wandered
forth into the wide world. After he had gone a while he came to a
hill; and there he met one who was the lord of all the beasts of the
forest--for they came when he blew his horn--and him the king asked
where Whiteland was. ""That I do not know,"" said he, ""but I will ask my
beasts."" Then he called them up with his horn, and asked whether any of
them knew where Whiteland might be; but none of them knew anything about it.

Then the man gave him a pair of snowshoes. ""If you stand in them,"" said
he, ""you will come to my brother, who lives a hundred miles further on.
He is the lord of the birds of the air. Ask him. When you have found
him, turn the snowshoes around so that they point this way, and they
will come back home of their own accord."" When the king got there, he
turned the snowshoes around, as the lord of the beasts had told him, and
they ran home again. He asked about Whiteland, and the man called up
all the birds with his horn, and asked whether any of them knew where
Whiteland might be. But none of them knew. Long after the rest an old
eagle came along; and he had been out for some ten years, but did not
know either."
9,"""Well,"" said the man, ""I will lend you a pair of snowshoes. When you
stand in them you will come to my brother, who lives a hundred miles
further on. He is the lord of all the fishes in the sea. Ask him. But do
not forget to turn the snowshoes around again."" The king thanked him,
stepped into the snowshoes, and when he came to the one who was lord of
all the fishes in the sea, he turned them around, and they ran back like
the others. There he once more asked about Whiteland.

The man called up his fishes with his horn, but none of them knew
anything about it. At last there came an old, old carp, whom he had
called with his horn only at the cost of much trouble. When he asked
him, he said: ""Yes, I know it well, for I was cook there for fully ten
years. To-morrow I have to go back again, because our queen, whose king
has not come home again, is going to marry some one else."" ""If such be
the case,"" said the man, ""I'll give you a bit of advice. Out there by
the wall three brothers have been standing for the last hundred years,
fighting with each other about a hat, a cloak and a pair of boots. Any
one who has these three things can make himself invisible, and wish
himself away as far as ever he will. You might say that you would test
their possessions, and then decide their quarrel for them."""
10,"Then the king thanked him, and did as he said. ""Why do you stand there fighting till the end of time?"" said he to the brothers. ""Let me test your
possessions if I am to decide your quarrel."" That suited them; but when
he had hat, cloak and boots, he told them: ""I will give you my decision
the next time we meet!"" and with that he wished himself far away. While
he was flying through the air he happened to meet the North Wind. ""And
where are you going?"" asked the North Wind. ""To Whiteland,"" said the
king, and then he told him what had happened to him. ""Well,"" said the
North Wind, ""you are traveling a little quicker than I am; for I must
sweep and blow out every corner. But when you come to your journey's
end, stand on the steps beside the door, and then I'll tt. And when the
prince who is to have the queen comes and looks out to see what it all
means, I'll just take him along with me."""
11,"The king did as the North Wind told him. He stationed himself on the
steps; and when the North Wind came roaring and rushing up, and laid
hold of the castle walls till they fairly shook, the prince came out to
see what it was all about. But that very moment the king seized him by
the collar, and threw him out, and the North Wind took him and carried
him off. When he had borne him away, the king went into the castle. At
first the queen did not recognize him, for he had grown thin and pale
because he had wandered so long in his great distress; but when he
showed her the ring, she grew glad at heart, and then they had a wedding
which was such a wedding that the news of it spread far and wide."
