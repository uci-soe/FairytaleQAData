1,"Once upon a time there lived at Vaero, not far from Rost, a poor
fisherman, named Isaac. He had nothing but a boat and a couple of goats,
which his wife fed as well as she could with fish leavings, and with the
grass she was able to gather on the surrounding hills. But his whole hut
was full of hungry children. Yet he was always satisfied with what God
sent him. The only thing that worried him was his inability to live at
peace with his neighbor. The latter was a rich man, thought himself
entitled to far more than such a beggarly fellow as Isaac. He wanted
to get him out of the way, in order to take for himself the anchorage
before Isaac's hut."
2,"One day Isaac had put out a few miles to sea to fish, when suddenly a
dark fog fell. In a flash such a tremendous storm broke, that he had
to throw all his fish overboard in order to lighten ship and save his
life. Even then it was very hard to keep the boat afloat. He steered
a careful course between and across the mountainous waves, which seemed
ready to swallow him from moment to moment. After he had kept on for
five or six hours in this manner, he thought that he ought to touch
land somewhere. But time went by, and the storm and fog grew worse and
worse. Then he began to realize that either he was steering out to sea,
or that the wind had veered, and at last he made sure the latter was the
case. He sailed on and on without a sight of land."
3,"Suddenly he heard a hideous cry from the stern of the boat, and felt certain that it was
the drang, who was singing his death-song. Then he prayed God to guard
his wife and children, for he thought his last hour had come. As he sat
there and prayed, he made out something black. When his boat drew
nearer, he noticed that it was only three cormorants, sitting on a piece
of drift-wood and--swish! he had passed them. Thus he sailed for a long
time, and grew so hungry, so thirsty and so weary that he did not know
what to do. The most part he sat with the rudder in his hand and
slept. But all of a sudden the boat ran up on a beach and stopped. Then
Isaac opened his eyes. The sun broke through the fog, and shone on a
beautiful land. Its hills and mountains were green to their very tops,
fields and meadows lay among their slopes. He seemed to breathe a
fragrance of flowers and grass sweeter than any he had ever known
before."
4,"""God be praised, now I am safe, for this is Udrost!"" said Isaac to
himself. Directly ahead of him lay a field of barley, with ears so
large and heavy that he had never seen their like. Through the
barley-field a narrow path led to a green turf-roofed cottage of clay,
that rose above the field. On the roof of the cottage grazed a white
goat with gilded horns, and an udder as large as that of the largest
cow. Before the door sat a little man clad in blue, puffing away at a
little pipe. He had a beard so long and so large that it hung far down
upon his breast."
5,"""Welcome to Udrost, Isaac!"" said the man.

""Good day to you, father,"" said Isaac, ""and do you know me?""

""It might be that I do,"" said the man. ""I suppose you want to stay here
overnight?""

""That would suit me very well, father,"" was Isaac's reply.

""The trouble is with my sons, for they cannot bear the smell of a
Christian,"" answered the man. ""Did you meet them?""

""No, I only met three cormorants, who were sitting on a piece of
drift-wood and croaking,"" was Isaac's reply.

""Well, those were my sons,"" said the man, and emptied his pipe, ""and now
come into the house, for I think you must be hungry and thirsty.""

""I'll take that liberty, father,"" said Isaac."
6,"When the man opened the door, everything within was so beautiful that
Isaac could not get over his admiration. He had never seen anything like
it. The table was covered with the finest dishes, bowls of cream, and
salmon and game, and liver dumplings with syrup, and cheese as well, and
there were whole piles of doughnuts, and there was mead, and everything
else that is good. Isaac ate and drank bravely, and yet his plate was
never empty. No matter how much he drank, his glass was always
full. The man neither ate much nor said much; but suddenly they heard a
noise and clamor before the house, and the man went out. After a time he
returned with his three sons, and Isaac trembled inwardly when they came
through the door. Their father must have quieted them, for they were
very friendly and amiable, and told Isaac he must use his guest-right,
and sit down and drink with them; for Isaac had risen to leave the
table, saying he had satisfied his hunger. But he gave in to them, and
they drank mead together, and became good friends. And they said that
Isaac must go fishing with them, so that he would have something to take
with him when he went home."
7,"The first time they put out a great storm was raging. One of the
sons sat at the rudder, the second at the bow, and the third in the
middle. Isaac had to work with the bailing-can until he dripped
perspiration. They sailed as though they were mad. They never reefed a
sail, and when the boat was full of water, they danced on the crests of
the waves, and slid down them so that the water in the stern spurted up
like a fountain. After a time the storm subsided, and they began to
fish. And the sea was so full of fish that they could not even put out
an anchor, since mountains of fish were piled up beneath them. The sons
of Udrost drew up one fish after another. Isaac knew his business; but
he had taken along his own fishing-tackle, and as soon as a fish bit he
let go again, and at last he had caught not a single one. When the boat
was filled, they sailed home again to Udrost, and the sons cleaned the
fish, and laid them on the stands. Meanwhile Isaac had complained to
their father of his poor luck. The man promised that he should do better
next time, and gave him a couple of hooks. The next time they went
out to fish, Isaac caught just as many as the others, and when they
reached home, he was given three stands of fish as his share."
8,"At length Isaac began to get homesick. When he was about to leave,
the man made him a present of a new fishing-boat, full of meal, and
tackle and other useful things. Isaac thanked him repeatedly, and the
man invited him to come back when the season opened again, since he
himself was going to take a cargo to Bergen, in the second stevne,
and Isaac could go along and sell his fish there himself. Isaac was more
than willing, and asked him what course he should set when he again
wanted to reach Udrost. ""All you need do is to follow the cormorant when
he heads for the open sea, then you will be on the right course,"" said
the man. ""Good luck on your way!"""
9,"But when Isaac got underway, and looked around, there was no Udrost in
sight. Far and wide, all around him, he saw no more than the ocean.

When the time came, Isaac sailed to join the man of Udrost's
fishing-craft. But such a craft he had never seen before. It was two
hails long, so that when the steersman, who was on look-out in the
stern, wanted to call out something to the rower, the latter could not
hear him. So they had stationed another man in the middle of the ship,
close by the mast, who had to relay the steersman's call to the rower,
and even he had to shout as loudly as he could in order to make
himself heard."
10,"Isaac's share was laid down in the forepart of the boat; and he himself
took down the fish from the stands; yet he could not understand how it
was that the stands were continually filled with fresh fish, no matter
how many he took away, and when he sailed away they were still as full
as ever. When he reached Bergen, he sold his fish, and got so much money
for them that he was able to buy a new schooner, completely fitted out,
and with a cargo to boot, as the man of Udrost had advised him. Late in
the evening, when he was about to sail for home, the man came aboard
and told him never to forget those who survived his neighbor, for his
neighbor himself had died. Then he wished Isaac all possible success
and good fortune for his schooner, in advance. ""All is well, and all
stands firm that towers in the air,"" said he, and what he meant was that
there was one aboard whom none could see, but who would support the mast
on his back, if need be."
11,"Since that time fortune was Isaac's friend. And well he knew why this
was so, and never forgot to prepare something good for whoever held the
winter watch, when the schooner was drawn up on land in the fall. And
every Christmas night there was the glow and shimmer of light, the
sound of fiddles and music, of laughter and merriment, and of dancing on
the deserted schooner."
