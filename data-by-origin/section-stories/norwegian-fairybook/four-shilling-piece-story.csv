1,"Once upon a time there was a poor woman, who lived in a wretched hut far
away from the village. She had but little to bite and less to burn, so
she sent her little boy to the forest to gather wood. He skipped and
leaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a
cold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch
to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for
the cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he
walked. When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he
crossed a field of stubble. There he saw lying a jagged white stone. ""O,
you poor old stone, how white and pale you are! You must be freezing
terribly!"" said the boy; took off his jacket, and laid it over the
stone. And when he came back home with his wood, his mother asked
him how it was that he was going around in the autumn cold in his
shirt-sleeves. He told her that he had seen a jagged old stone, quite
white and pale with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket. ""You
fool,"" said the woman, ""do you think a stone can freeze? And even if it
had chattered with frost, still, charity begins at home. Your clothes
cost enough as it is, even when you don't hang them on the stones out
in the field!""--and with that she drove the boy out again to fetch his
jacket. When he came to the stone, the stone had turned around, and had
raised itself from the ground on one side."
2,"""Yes, and I'm sure it is because you have the jacket, poor fellow!"" said the boy. But when he looked more closely, there was a chest full of bright silver coins under the stone. ""That must be stolen money,"" thought the boy, ""for no one
lays money honestly earned under stones in the wood."" And he took the
chest, and carried it down to the pond nearby, and threw in the whole
pile of money. But a four-shilling piece was left swimming on the top
of the water. ""Well, this one is honest, for whatever is honest will
float,"" said the boy. And he took the four-shilling piece and the jacket
home with him. He told his mother what had happened to him, that the
stone had turned around, and that he had found a chest full of silver
coins, and had thrown it into the pond because it was stolen money. ""But
a four-shilling piece floated, and that I took along, because it was
honest,"" said the boy. ""You are a fool,"" said the woman--for she was as
angry as could be--""if nothing were honest save what floats on the
water, there would be but little honesty left in the world. And if
the money had been stolen ten times over, still you had found it, and
charity begins at home. If you had kept the money, we might have passed
the rest of our lives in peace and comfort. But you are a dunderhead and
will stay a dunderhead, and I won't be tormented and burdened with you
any longer. Now you must get out and earn your own living."""
3,"So the boy had to go out into the wide world, and wandered about far
and near looking for service. But wherever he went people found him too
small or too weak, and said that they could make no use of him. At last
he came to a merchant. There they kept him to work in the kitchen, and
he had to fetch wood and water for the cook. When he had been there for
some time, the merchant decided to journey to far countries, and asked
all his servants what he should buy and bring back home for them.
After all had told him what they wanted, came the turn of the little
fellow who carried wood and water for the kitchen. He handed him his
four-shilling piece. ""Well, and what am I to buy for it?"" asked the
merchant. ""It will not be a large purchase."" ""Buy whatever it will
bring, it is honest money, that I know,"" said the boy. His master
promised to do so, and sailed away."
4,"Now when the merchant had discharged his cargo in foreign parts and had
reloaded, and had bought what his servants had desired, he went back to
his ship, and was about to shove off. Not until then did he remember
that the scullion had given him a four-shilling piece, with which to
buy him something. ""Must I go up to the city again because of this
four-shilling piece? One only has one's troubles when one bothers with
such truck,"" thought the merchant. Then along came a woman with a bag on
her back. ""What have you in your bag, granny?"" asked the merchant. ""O,
it is only a cat! I can feed her no longer, and so I want to throw her
into the sea in order to get rid of her,"" said the old woman. ""The boy
told me to buy whatever I could get for the four-shilling piece,"" said
the merchant to himself, and asked the woman whether he could have her
cat for four shillings. The woman agreed without delay, and the bargain
was closed."
5,"Now when the merchant had sailed on for a while, a terrible storm broke
loose, a thunderstorm without an equal, and he drifted and drifted, and
did not know where or whither. At last he came to a land where he had
never yet been, and went up into the city.

In the tavern which he entered the table was set, and at every place lay
a switch, one for each guest. This seemed strange to the merchant, for
he could not understand what was to be done with all the switches. Yet
he sat down and thought: ""I will watch carefully, and see just what the
rest do with them, and then I can imitate them."" Yes, and when the food
came on the table, then he knew why the switches were there: the place
was alive with thousands of mice, and all who were sitting at the table
had to work and fight and beat about them with their switches, and
nothing could be heard but the slapping of the switches, one worse than
the other. Sometimes people hit each other in the face, and then they
had to take time to say, ""Excuse me!"""
6,"""Eating is hard work in this country,"" said the merchant. ""How is it
the folk here have no cats?"" ""Cats?"" said the people: they did not know
what they were. Then the merchant had the cat that he had bought for the
scullion brought, and when the cat went over the table, the mice had to
hurry into their holes, and not in the memory of man had the people been
able to eat in such comfort. Then they begged and implored the merchant
to sell them his cat. At last he said he would let them have her; but he
wanted a hundred dollars for her, and this they paid, and thanked him
kindly into the bargain."
7,"Then the merchant sailed on, but no sooner had he reached the high seas
than he saw the cat sitting at the top of the main-mast. And immediately
after another storm and tempest arose, far worse than the first one, and
he drifted and drifted, till he came to a land where he had never yet
been. Again the merchant went to a tavern, and here, too, the table was
covered with switches; but they were much larger and longer than at the
place where he had first been. And they were much needed; for there were
a good many more mice, and they were twice the size of those he had
first seen."
8,"Here he again sold his cat, and this time he received two hundred
dollars for her, and that without any haggling. But when he had sailed
off and was out at sea a way, there sat the cat up in the mast. And the
storm at once began again, and finally he was again driven to a land in
which he had never been. Again he turned in at a tavern, and there the
table was also covered with switches; but every switch was a yard and a
half long, and as thick as a small broom, and the people told him that
they knew of nothing more disagreeable than to sit down to eat, for
there were great, ugly rats by the thousand. Only with toil and trouble
could one manage to shove a bite of something into one's mouth once in a
while, so hard was it to defend oneself against the rats. Then the cat
was again brought from the ship, and now the people could eat in peace.
They begged and pleaded that the merchant sell them his cat; and for a
long time he refused; but at last he promised that they should have her
for three hundred dollars. And they paid him, and thanked him, and
blessed him into the bargain."
9,"Now when the merchant was out at sea again, he considered how much the
boy had gained with the four-shilling piece he had given him. ""Well, he
shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not
all of it. For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him,
and charity begins at home.""

But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and
tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink. Then the merchant
realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that
the boy should have all the money. No sooner had he made his vow, than
the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey
home. And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and
his daughter to boot. For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant
himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness.
And he took in his mother and treated her kindly. ""For I do not believe
that charity begins at home,"" said the youth."
