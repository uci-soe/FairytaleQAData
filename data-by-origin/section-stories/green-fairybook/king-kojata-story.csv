1,"There was once upon a time a king called Kojata, whose beard was so
long that it reached below his knees. Three years had passed since his
marriage, and he lived very happily with his wife, but Heaven granted
him no heir, which grieved the King greatly. One day he set forth
from his capital, in order to make a journey through his kingdom.
He travelled for nearly a year through the different parts of his
territory, and then, having seen all there was to be seen, he set forth
on his homeward way. As the day was very hot and sultry he commanded his
servants to pitch tents in the open field, and there await the cool of
the evening. Suddenly a frightful thirst seized the King, and as he saw
no water near, he mounted his horse, and rode through the neighbourhood
looking for a spring. Before long he came to a well filled to the brim
with water clear as crystal, and on the bosom of which a golden jug was
floating. King Kojata at once tried to seize the vessel, but though he
endeavoured to grasp it with his right hand, and then with his left, the
wretched thing always eluded his efforts and refused to let itself be
caught. First with one hand, and then with two, did the King try to
seize it, but like a fish the goblet always slipped through his fingers
and bobbed to the ground only to reappear at some other place, and mock
the King."
2,"'Plague on you!' said King Kojata. 'I can quench my thirst without you,'
and bending over the well he lapped up the water so greedily that he
plunged his face, beard and all, right into the crystal mirror. But when
he had satisfied his thirst, and wished to raise himself up, he couldn't
lift his head, because someone held his beard fast in the water. 'Who's
there? let me go!' cried King Kojata, but there was no answer; only an
awful face looked up from the bottom of the well with two great green
eyes, glowing like emeralds, and a wide mouth reaching from ear to ear
showing two rows of gleaming white teeth, and the King's beard was held,
not by mortal hands, but by two claws. At last a hoarse voice sounded
from the depths. 'Your trouble is all in vain, King Kojata; I will only
let you go on condition that you give me something you know nothing
about, and which you will find on your return home.'

The King didn't pause to ponder long, 'for what,' thought he, 'could be
in my palace without my knowing about it--the thing is absurd;' so he
answered quickly:

'Yes, I promise that you shall have it.'

The voice replied, 'Very well; but it will go ill with you if you fail
to keep your promise.' Then the claws relaxed their hold, and the face
disappeared in the depths. The King drew his chin out of the water,
and shook himself like a dog; then he mounted his horse and rode
thoughtfully home with his retinue."
3,"When they approached the capital, all the people came out to meet them with great joy and acclamation,
and when the King reached his palace the Queen met him on the threshold;
beside her stood the Prime Minister, holding a little cradle in his
hands, in which lay a new-born child as beautiful as the day. Then
the whole thing dawned on the King, and groaning deeply he muttered to
himself 'So this is what I did not know about,' and the tears rolled
down his cheeks. All the courtiers standing round were much amazed at
the King's grief, but no one dared to ask him the cause of it. He took
the child in his arms and kissed it tenderly; then laying it in its
cradle, he determined to control his emotion and began to reign again as
before.

The secret of the King remained a secret, though his grave, careworn
expression escaped no one's notice. In the constant dread that his child
would be taken from him, poor Kojata knew no rest night or day. However,
time went on and nothing happened. Days and months and years passed, and
the Prince grew up into a beautiful youth, and at last the King himself
forgot all about the incident that had happened so long ago."
4,"One day the Prince went out hunting, and going in pursuit of a wild boar
he soon lost the other huntsmen, and found himself quite alone in the
middle of a dark wood. The trees grew so thick and near together that it
was almost impossible to see through them, only straight in front of
him lay a little patch of meadowland. Overgrown with thistles and rank
weeds, in the centre of which a leafy lime tree reared itself.
Suddenly a rustling sound was heard in the hollow of the tree, and an
extraordinary old man with green eyes and chin crept out of it.

'A fine day, Prince Milan,' he said; 'you've kept me waiting a good
number of years; it was high time for you to come and pay me a visit.'

'Who are you, in the name of wonder?' demanded the astonished Prince.

'You'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime do as I bid you. Greet
your father King Kojata from me, and don't forget to remind him of his
debt; the time has long passed since it was due, but now he will have to
pay it. Farewell for the present; we shall meet again.'

With these words the old man disappeared into the tree, and the Prince
returned home rather startled, and told his father all that he had seen
and heard.

The King grew as white as a sheet when he heard the Prince's story, and
said, 'Woe is me, my son! The time has come when we must part,' and with
a heavy heart he told the Prince what had happened at the time of his
birth."
5,"'Don't worry or distress yourself, dear father,' answered Prince Milan.
'Things are never as bad as they look. Only give me a horse for my
journey, and I wager you'll soon see me back again.'

The King gave him a beautiful charger, with golden stirrups, and a
sword. The Queen hung a little cross round his neck, and after much
weeping and lamentation the Prince bade them all farewell and set forth
on his journey.

He rode straight on for two days, and on the third he came to a lake as
smooth as glass and as clear as crystal. Not a breath of wind moved, not
a leaf stirred, all was silent as the grave, only on the still bosom of
the lake thirty ducks, with brilliant plumage, swam about in the water.
Not far from the shore Prince Milan noticed thirty little white garments
lying on the grass, and dismounting from his horse, he crept down under
the high bulrushes, took one of the garments and hid himself with it
behind the bushes which grew round the lake. The ducks swam about all
over the place, dived down into the depths and rose again and glided
through the waves. At last, tired of disporting themselves, they swam
to the shore, and twenty-nine of them put on their little white garments
and instantly turned into so many beautiful maidens. Then they finished
dressing and disappeared. Only the thirtieth little duck couldn't
come to the land; it swam about close to the shore, and, giving out a
piercing cry, it stretched its neck up timidly, gazed wildly around, and
then dived under again."
6,"Prince Milan's heart was so moved with pity for
the poor little creature that he came out from behind the bulrushes, to
see if he could be of any help. As soon as the duck perceived him, it
cried in a human voice, 'Oh, dear Prince Milan, for the love of Heaven
give me back my garment, and I will be so grateful to you.' The Prince
lay the little garment on the bank beside her, and stepped back into the
bushes. In a few seconds a beautiful girl in a white robe stood before
him, so fair and sweet and young that no pen could describe her. She
gave the Prince her hand and spoke.

'Many thanks, Prince Milan, for your courtesy. I am the daughter of a
wicked magician, and my name is Hyacinthia. My father has thirty young
daughters, and is a mighty ruler in the underworld, with many castles
and great riches. He has been expecting you for ages, but you need have
no fear if you will only follow my advice. As soon as you come into the
presence of my father, throw yourself at once on the ground and approach
him on your knees. Don't mind if he stamps furiously with his feet and
curses and swears. I'll attend to the rest, and in the meantime we had
better be off.'

With these words the beautiful Hyacinthia stamped on the ground with her
little foot, and the earth opened and they both sank down into the lower
world."
7,"The palace of the Magician was all hewn out of a single carbuncle,
lighting up the whole surrounding region, and Prince Milan walked into
it gaily.

The Magician sat on a throne, a sparkling crown on his head; his eyes
blazed like a green fire, and instead of hands he had claws. As soon as
Prince Milan entered he flung himself on his knees. The Magician stamped
loudly with his feet, glared frightfully out of his green eyes, and
cursed so loudly that the whole underworld shook. But the Prince,
mindful of the counsel he had been given, wasn't the least afraid, and
approached the throne still on his knees. At last the Magician laughed
aloud and said, 'You rogue, you have been well advised to make me laugh;
I won't be your enemy any more. Welcome to the underworld! All the same,
for your delay in coming here, we must demand three services from you.
For to-day you may go, but to-morrow I shall have something more to say
to you.'

Then two servants led Prince Milan to a beautiful apartment, and he lay
down fearlessly on the soft bed that had been prepared for him, and was
soon fast asleep.

Early the next morning the Magician sent for him, and said, 'Let's see
now what you've learnt. In the first place you must build me a palace
to-night, the roof of purest gold, the walls of marble, and the
windows of crystal; all round you must lay out a beautiful garden, with
fish-ponds and artistic waterfalls. If you do all this, I will reward
you richly; but if you don't, you shall lose your head.'"
8,"'Oh, you wicked monster!' thought Prince Milan, 'you might as well have
put me to death at once.' Sadly he returned to his room, and with bent
head sat brooding over his cruel fate till evening. When it grew dark, a
little bee flew by, and knocking at the window, it said, 'Open, and let
me in.'

Milan opened the window quickly, and as soon as the bee had entered, it
changed into the beautiful Hyacinthia.

'Good evening, Prince Milan. Why are you so sad?'

'How can I help being sad? Your father threatens me with death, and I
see myself already without a head.'

'And what have you made up your mind to do?'

'There's nothing to be done, and after all I suppose one can only die
once.'"
9,"'Now, don't be so foolish, my dear Prince; but keep up your spirits, for
there is no need to despair. Go to bed, and when you wake up to-morrow
morning the palace will be finished. Then you must go all round it,
giving a tap here and there on the walls to look as if you had just
finished it.'

And so it all turned out just as she had said. As soon as it was
daylight Prince Milan stepped out of his room, and found a palace which
was quite a work of art down to the very smallest detail. The Magician
himself was not a little astonished at its beauty, and could hardly
believe his eyes.

'Well, you certainly are a splendid workman,' he said to the Prince.
'I see you are very clever with your hands, now I must see if you are
equally accomplished with your head. I have thirty daughters in my
house, all beautiful princesses. To-morrow I will place the whole thirty
in a row. You must walk past them three times, and the third time you
must show me which is my youngest daughter Hyacinthia. If you don't
guess rightly, you shall lose your head.'"
10,"'This time you've made a mistake,' thought Prince Milan, and going to
his room he sat down at the window. 'Just fancy my not recognising the
beautiful Hyacinthia! Why, that is the easiest thing in the world.'

'Not so easy as you think,' cried the little bee, who was flying past.
'If I weren't to help you, you'd never guess. We are thirty sisters so
exactly alike that our own father can hardly distinguish us apart.'

'Then what am I to do?' asked Prince Milan.

'Listen,' answered Hyacinthia. 'You will recognise me by a tiny fly I
shall have on my left cheek, but be careful for you might easily make a
mistake.'"
11,"The next day the Magician again commanded Prince Milan to be led before
him. His daughters were all arranged in a straight row in front of him,
dressed exactly alike, and with their eyes bent on the ground.

'Now, you genius,' said the Magician, 'look at these beauties three
times, and then tell us which is the Princess Hyacinthia.'

Prince Milan went past them and looked at them closely. But they were
all so precisely alike that they looked like one face reflected in
thirty mirrors, and the fly was nowhere to be seen; the second time
he passed them he still saw nothing; but the third time he perceived a
little fly stealing down one cheek, causing it to blush a faint pink.
Then the Prince seized the girl's hand and cried out, 'This is the
Princess Hyacinthia!'

'You're right again,' said the Magician in amazement; 'but I've still
another task for you to do. Before this candle, which I shall light,
burns to the socket, you must have made me a pair of boots reaching to
my knees. If they aren't finished in that time, off comes your head.'"
12,"The Prince returned to his room in despair; then the Princess Hyacinthia
came to him once more changed into the likeness of a bee, and asked him,
'Why so sad, Prince Milan?'

'How can I help being sad? Your father has set me this time an
impossible task. Before a candle which he has lit burns to the socket,
I am to make a pair of boots. But what does a prince know of shoemaking?
If I can't do it, I lose my head.'

'And what do you mean to do?' asked Hyacinthia.

'Well, what is there to be done? What he demands I can't and won't do,
so he must just make an end of me.'

'Not so, dearest. I love you dearly, and you shall marry me, and I'll
either save your life or die with you. We must fly now as quickly as we
can, for there is no other way of escape.'

With these words she breathed on the window, and her breath froze on the
pane. Then she led Milan out of the room with her, shut the door, and
threw the key away. Hand in hand, they hurried to the spot where they
had descended into the lower world, and at last reached the banks of the
lake. Prince Milan's charger was still grazing on the grass which grew
near the water. The horse no sooner recognized his master, than it
neighed loudly with joy, and springing towards him, it stood as if
rooted to the ground, while Prince Milan and Hyacinthia jumped on its
back. Then it sped onwards like an arrow from a bow."
13,"In the meantime the Magician was waiting impatiently for the Prince.
Enraged by the delay, he sent his servants to fetch him, for the
appointed time was past.

The servants came to the door, and finding it locked, they knocked; but
the frozen breath on the window replied in Prince Milan's voice, 'I am
coming directly.' With this answer they returned to the Magician. But
when the Prince still did not appear, after a time he sent his servants
a second time to bring him. The frozen breath always gave the same
answer, but the Prince never came. At last the Magician lost all
patience, and commanded the door to be burst open. But when his servants
did so, they found the room empty, and the frozen breath laughed
aloud. Out of his mind with rage, the Magician ordered the Prince to be
pursued."
14,"Then a wild chase began. 'I hear horses' hoofs behind us,' said
Hyacinthia to the Prince. Milan sprang from the saddle, put his ear to
the ground and listened. 'Yes,' he answered, 'they are pursuing us, and
are quite close.' 'Then no time must be lost,' said Hyacinthia, and
she immediately turned herself into a river, Prince Milan into an iron
bridge, and the charger into a blackbird. Behind the bridge the road
branched off into three ways.

The Magician's servants hurried after the fresh tracks, but when they
came to the bridge, they stood, not knowing which road to take, as the
footprints stopped suddenly, and there were three paths for them to
choose from. In fear and trembling they returned to tell the Magician
what had happened. He flew into a dreadful rage when he saw them, and
screamed out, 'Oh, you fools! the river and bridge were they! Go back
and bring them to me at once, or it will be the worse for you.'"
15,"Then the pursuit began afresh. 'I hear horses' hoofs,' sighed
Hyacinthia. The Prince dismounted and put his ear to the ground. 'They
are hurrying after us, and are already quite near.' In a moment the
Princess Hyacinthia had changed herself, the Prince, and his charger
into a thick wood where a thousand paths and roads crossed each other.
Their pursuers entered the forest, but searched in vain for Prince Milan
and his bride. At last they found themselves back at the same spot they
had started from, and in despair they returned once more with empty
hands to the Magician.

'Then I'll go after the wretches myself,' he shouted. 'Bring a horse at
once; they shan't escape me.'

Once more the beautiful Hyacinthia murmured, 'I hear horses' hoofs quite
near.' And the Prince answered, 'They are pursuing us hotly and are
quite close.'

'We are lost now, for that is my father himself. But at the first church
we come to his power ceases; he may chase us no further. Hand me your
cross.'

Prince Milan loosened from his neck the little gold cross his mother had
given him, and as soon as Hyacinthia grasped it, she had changed herself
into a church, Milan into a monk, and the horse into a belfry. They had
hardly done this when the magician and his servants rode up.

'Did you see no one pass by on horseback, reverend father?' he asked the
monk.

'Prince Milan and Princess Hyacinthia have just gone on this minute;
they stopped for a few minutes in the church to say their prayers, and
bade me light this wax candle for you, and give you their love.'"
16,"'I'd like to wring their necks,' said the magician, and made all haste
home, where he had every one of his servants beaten to within an inch of
their lives.

Prince Milan rode on slowly with his bride without fearing any further
pursuit. The sun was just setting, and its last rays lit up a large city
they were approaching. Prince Milan was suddenly seized with an ardent
desire to enter the town.

'Oh my beloved,' implored Hyacinthia, 'please don't go; for I am
frightened and fear some evil.'

'What are you afraid of?' asked the Prince. 'We'll only go and look at
what's to be seen in the town for about an hour, and then we'll continue
our journey to my father's kingdom.'"
17,"'The town is easy to get into, but more difficult to get out of,' sighed
Hyacinthia. 'But let it be as you wish. Go, and I will await you here,
but I will first change myself into a white milestone; only I pray you
be very careful. The King and Queen of the town will come out to meet
you, leading a little child with them. Whatever you do, don't kiss the
child, or you will forget me and all that has happened to us. I will
wait for you here for three days.'

The Prince hurried to the town, but Hyacinthia remained behind disguised
as a white milestone on the road. The first day passed, and then the
second, and at last the third also, but Prince Milan did not return,
for he had not taken Hyacinthia's advice. The King and Queen came out to
meet him as she had said, leading with them a lovely fair-haired little
girl, whose eyes shone like two clear stars. The child at once caressed
the Prince, who, carried away by its beauty, bent down and kissed it on
the cheek. From that moment his memory became a blank, and he forgot all
about the beautiful Hyacinthia."
18,"When the Prince did not return, poor Hyacinthia wept bitterly and
changing herself from a milestone into a little blue field flower, she
said, 'I will grow here on the wayside till some passer-by tramples me
under foot.' And one of her tears remained as a dewdrop and sparkled on
the little blue flower.

Now it happened shortly after this that an old man passed by, and seeing
the flower, he was delighted with its beauty. He pulled it up carefully
by the roots and carried it home. Here he planted it in a pot, and
watered and tended the little plant carefully. And now the most
extraordinary thing happened, for from this moment everything in the old
man's house was changed. When he awoke in the morning he always found
his room tidied and put into such beautiful order that not a speck of
dust was to be found anywhere. When he came home at midday, he found a
table laid out with the most dainty food, and he had only to sit down
and enjoy himself to his heart's content. At first he was so surprised
he didn't know what to think, but after a time he grew a little
uncomfortable, and went to an old witch to ask for advice.

The witch said, 'Get up before the cock crows, and watch carefully till
you see something move, and then throw this cloth quickly over it, and
you'll see what will happen.'"
19,"All night the old man never closed an eye. When the first ray of light
entered the room, he noticed that the little blue flower began to
tremble, and at last it rose out of the pot and flew about the room,
put everything in order, swept away the dust, and lit the fire. In great
haste the old man sprang from his bed, and covered the flower with
the cloth the old witch had given him, and in a moment the beautiful
Princess Hyacinthia stood before him.

'What have you done?' she cried. 'Why have you called me back to life?
For I have no desire to live since my bridegroom, the beautiful Prince
Milan, has deserted me.'

'Prince Milan is just going to be married,' replied the old man.
'Everything is being got ready for the feast, and all the invited guests
are flocking to the palace from all sides.'

The beautiful Hyacinthia cried bitterly when she heard this; then she
dried her tears, and went into the town dressed as a peasant woman. She
went straight to the King's kitchen, where the white-aproned cooks were
running about in great confusion. The Princess went up to the head cook,
and said, 'Dear cook, please listen to my request, and let me make a
wedding-cake for Prince Milan.'

The busy cook was just going to refuse her demand and order her out of
the kitchen, but the words died on his lips when he turned and beheld
the beautiful Hyacinthia, and he answered politely, 'You have just come
in the nick of time, fair maiden. Bake your cake, and I myself will lay
it before Prince Milan.'"
20,"The cake was soon made. The invited guests were already thronging round
the table, when the head cook entered the room, bearing a beautiful
wedding cake on a silver dish, and laid it before Prince Milan. The
guests were all lost in admiration, for the cake was quite a work of
art. Prince Milan at once proceeded to cut it open, when to his surprise
two white doves sprang out of it, and one of them said to the other: 'My
dear mate, do not fly away and leave me, and forget me as Prince Milan
forgot his beloved Hyacinthia.'

Milan sighed deeply when he heard what the little dove said. Then he
jumped up suddenly from the table and ran to the door, where he found
the beautiful Hyacinthia waiting for him. Outside stood his faithful
charger, pawing the ground. Without pausing for a moment, Milan and
Hyacinthia mounted him and galloped as fast as they could into the
country of King Kojata. The King and Queen received them with such
joy and gladness as had never been heard of before, and they all lived
happily for the rest of their lives."
