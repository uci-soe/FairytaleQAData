1,"There was once a king, called King O'Toole, who was a fine old king in
the old ancient times, long ago. It was him that owned the Churches
in the early days.

""Surely,"" said I, ""the Churches were not in King O'Toole's time?""

""Oh, by no means, your honor--truth, it's yourself that's right enough
there. But you know the place is called 'The Churches' because they were
built after by St. Kavin, and went by the name of the Churches ever
more. Therefore, of course, the place bein' so called, I say that
the King owned the Churches--and why not, sir, seein' it was his
birthright, time out o' mind, beyond the flood? Well, the King (you see)
was the right sort--he was the real boy, and loved sport as he loved
his life, and huntin' in particular. From the risin' o' the sun up
he got, and away he went over the mountains beyond after the deer: and
the fine times them were. The deer was as plenty thin, aye truth,
far more plentiful than the sheep is now. That's the way it was with the
King, from the crow o' the cock to the song o' the redbreast."""
2,"Well, it
was all mighty good as long as the King had his health. But, you see, in
coorse o' time, the King grew old, by reason he was stiff in his
limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart failed him. He
was lost entirely for want o' diversions, because he couldn't go a huntin'
no longer. By dad, the poor King was obliged at last for to get a
goose to distract him. You see, the goose used for to swim across the
lake, and go down divin' for trout (and not finer trout in all Ireland
than the same trout) and catch fish on a Friday for the King. If flew
every other day round about the lake disctracting the poor King that you'd
think he'd break his sides laughin' at the frolicksome tricks of his
goose. So, in course o' time, the goose was the greatest pet in the
country, and the biggest rogue, and distracted the King to no end.
The poor King was as happy as the day was long. So that's the way it
was. All went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken
in years, as well as the King, and grew stiff in the limbs, like her
master, and couldn't distract him no longer. Then it was that the
poor King was lost completely, and didn't know what in the wide world to
do. He was gone out of all distractions because the goose was
no more in the flower of her blume.

Well, the King was nigh broken-hearted and melancholy entirely, and was
walkin' one mornin' by the edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate,
an' thinkin' o' drownin' himself, that could get no diversion in life,
when all of a sudden, turnin' round the corner beyond, who should he
meet but a mighty decent young man comin' up to him."
3,"'God save you,' says the King (for the King was a civil-spoken
gentleman, by all accounts), 'God save you,' says he to the young man.

'God save you kindly,' says the young man to him back again. 'God save
you, King O'Toole.'

'True for you,' says the King, 'I am King O'Toole,' says he. 'Prince
and plennypennytinchery o' these parts,' says he. 'But how came you to
know that?' says he.

'Oh, never mind,' says Saint Kavin (for 'twas he that was in it). 'And
now, may I make bold to ask, how is your goose, King O'Toole?' says he.

'Blur-an-agers, how came you to know about my goose?' says the King.

'Oh, no mather. I was given to understand it,' says Saint Kavin.

'Oh, that's a folly to talk,' says the King, 'because myself and my
goose is private friends,' says he, 'and no one could tell you,' says
he, 'barrin' the fairies.'

'Oh, then, it wasn't the fairies,' says Saint Kavin. 'For I'd have you
know,' says he, 'that I don't keep the likes o' such company.'

'You might do worse, then, my gay fellow,' says the King. 'For it's
they could show you a crock o' money as easy as kiss hand. And that's
not to be sneezed at,' says the King, 'by a poor man,' says he.

'Maybe I've a better way of making money myself,' says the saint.

'By gor,' says the King, 'barrin' you're a coiner,' says he, 'that's
impossible!'

'I'd scorn to be the like, my lord!' says Saint Kavin, mighty high,
'I'd scorn to be the like,' says he.

'Then, what are you?' says the King, 'that makes money so easy, by your
own account.'

'I'm an honest man,' says Saint Kavin."
4,"'Well, honest man,' says the King, 'and how is it you make your money
so easy?'

'By makin' old things as good as new,' says Saint Kavin.

'Is it a tinker you are?' says the King.

'No,' says the saint; 'I'm no tinker by trade, King O'Toole. I've a
better thrade than a tinker,' says he. 'What would you say,' says he,
'if I made your old goose as good as new?'

'My dear, at the word o' making his goose as good as new, you'd think
the poor old King's eyes was ready to jump out of his head.' 'And,' says
he--'truth, then, I'd give you more money nor you could count,' says
he, 'if you did the like, and I'd be beholden to you in the bargain.'

'I scorn your dirty money,' says Saint Kavin.

'Faith, then, I'm thinkin' a trifle o' change would do you no harm,'
says the King, lookin' up sly at the old hat that Saint Kavin had
on him.

'I have a vow agin it,' says the saint. 'I am book sworn,' says he,
'never to have gold, silver, or brass in my company.'

'Barrin' the trifle you can't help,' says the King, mighty cute, and
looking him straight in the face.

'You just hot it,' says Saint Kavin. 'But though I can't take money,'
says he, 'I could take a few acres o' land, if you'd give them to me.'

'With all the veins o' my heart,' says the King, 'if you can do what
you say.'

'Try me!' says Saint Kavin. 'Call down your goose here,' says he, 'and
I'll see what I can do for her.'"
5,"With that the King whistled, and down came the poor goose, all as one as
a hound, waddlin' up to the poor old cripple, her master, and as like
him as two pays. The minute the saint set his eyes on the goose, 'I'll
do the job for you,' says he, 'King O'Toole!'

'By Jaminee,' says King O'Toole, 'if you do, but I'll say you're the
cleverest fellow in the seven parishes.'

'Oh, by dad,' says Saint Kavin, 'you must say more nor that--my horn's
not so soft all out,' says he, 'as to repair your old goose for
nothin'. 'What'll you give me if I do the job for you?--that's the chat,'
says Saint Kavin.

'I'll give you whatever you ask,' says the King. 'isn't that fair?'

'Devil a fairer,' says the saint. 'That's the way to do business. Now,'
says he, 'this is the bargain I'll make with you, King O'Toole: will you
give me all the ground the goose flies over, the first offer, after I
make her as good as new?'

'I will,' says the King.

'You won't go back o' your word?' says Saint Kavin.

'Honor bright!' says King O'Toole, holdin' out his fist.

'Honor bright,' says Saint Kavin back again, 'it's a bargain,' says he.
'Come here!' says he to the poor old goose--'come here, you
unfortunate old cripple,' says he, 'and it's I that'll make you the
sportin' bird.'"
6,"'With that, my dear, he took up the goose by the two wings--criss o' my
cross an you,' says he, markin' her to grace with the blessed sign at
the same minute. And throwin' her up in the air, 'whew!' says he, just
givin' her a blast to help her. With that, my jewel, she took to her
heels, flyin' like one o' the eagles themselves, and cuttin' as many
capers as a swallow before a shower of rain. Away she went down there,
right in front of you, along the side o' the cliff, and flew over Saint
Kavin's bed (that is, where Saint Kavin's bed is now, but was not
then, by reason as it wasn't made, but was contrived after by Saint
Kavin himself, that the women might leave him alone). And on with her
under Lugduff, and round the end of the lake there, far beyond where
you see the waterfall. And on with her then right over the lead mines
o' Luganure (that is, where the lead mines is now, but was not then,
by reason they weren't discovered, but was all gold in Saint Kavin's
time). Well, over the end o' Luganure she flew, stout and studdy, and
round the other end of the little lake, by the Churches (that is, of course, where the Churches is now, but was not then, by reason they
were not built, but afterwards by Saint Kavin), and over the big hill
here over your head, where you see the big cliff--(and that cliff in the
mountain was made by Finn Ma Cool, where he cut it across with a big
sword that he got made a purpose by a blacksmith out o' Rathdrum, a
cousin of his own, for to fight a giant that dared him an' the
Curragh o' Kildare. He tried the sword first an the mountain, and
cut it down into a gap, as is plain to this day. Faith, sure enough,
it's the same sauce he served the giant, soon and sudden, and chopped
him in two like a potato, for the glory of his soul and old
Ireland)--well, down she flew over the cliff, and flutterin' over the
wood there at Poulanass."
7,"'Well--as I said--afther flutterin' over the
wood a little bit, to plaze herself, the goose flew down, and bit at
the foot o' the King, as fresh as a daisy, after flyin' round his
dominions, just as if she hadn't flew three perch.'

'Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the King standin' with
his mouth open, lookin' at his poor old goose flyin' as light as a
lark, and better nor ever she was. When she let at his foot he
patted her an the head, and ma vourneen,' says he, 'but you are the
darling o' the world.'

'And what do you say to me,' says Saint Kavin, 'for makin' her the
like?'

'By gor,' says the King, ""I say nothin' about the art o' men, barrin'
the bees.""

'And do you say no more nor that?' says Saint Kavin.

'And that I'm beholden to you,' says the King.

'But will you give me all the ground the goose flew over?' says Saint
Kavin.

'I will,' says King O'Toole, 'and you're welcome to it,' says he,
'though it's the last acre I have to give.'

'But you'll keep your word true?' says the saint.

'As true as the sun,' says the King."
8,"'It's well for you,' says Saint Kavin, mighty sharp--'it's well for
you, King O'Toole, that you said that word,' says he. 'For if you didn't
say that word, the devil recieve the bit o' your goose id ever fly
again,' says Saint Kavin.

'Oh, you needn't laugh,' said old Joe, 'for it's truth I'm telling
you.'

Well, when the King was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was pleased
with him, and then it was that he made himself known to the King.

""Well, my dear, that's the way that the place came, all at once, into
the hands of Saint Kavin. The goose flew round every individual
acre o' King O'Toole's property, you see, bein' let into the secret
by Saint Kavin, who was mighty cute. So, when he done the old
King out of his property for the glory of God, he was pleased with him.
He and the King was the best o' friends ever more after (for the
poor old King was doatin' , you see), and the King had his goose as
good as new to distract him as long as he lived. The saint supported
him after he came into his property, as I told you, until the day of
his death--and that was soon afther. The poor goose thought he was
catchin' a trout one Friday. But, my jewel, it was a mistake he
made--and instead of a throut, it was a thievin' horse-eel! and, by gor,
instead of the goose killin' a trout for the King's supper--by dad, the
eel killed the King's goose--and small blame to him. But he didn't ate
her, because he doesn't eat what Saint Kavin laid his blessed hands on."""
