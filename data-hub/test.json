' ' then be quick and do n't waste my time , for i ca n't wait much longer . what is it you want ? ' ' you must know , ' said the fox , ' that in this village there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year , and keeps them in an old well , now dry , in his courtyard . by the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used , in former days , to draw up water . for many nights i have crept down to the palace , and have lowered myself in the bucket , bringing home with me enough cheese to feed the children . all i beg of you is to come with me , and , instead of hunting chickens and such things , i will make a good meal off cheese before i die . ' ' but the cheeses may be all finished by now ? ' ' if you were only to see the quantities of them ! ' laughed the fox . ' and even if they were finished , there would always be me to eat .
