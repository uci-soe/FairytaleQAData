the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,MR.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"JEREMY put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"THE boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,MR.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"JEREMY took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"""I know a good place for minnows,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,MR.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,JEREMY stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,He had the dearest little red float.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"THE rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"""This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"HE punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"""I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,A GREAT big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,ONCE or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"""I trust that is not a rat,"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; ""I think I had better get away from here."""
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,MR.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"JEREMY shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"""A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!"""
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,BUT what a horrible surprise!
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!"
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"THE stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,Then he jumped back into the water.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"AND a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"AND while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a MUCH worse thing happened; a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh!"
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,A GREAT big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p!
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"with a splash--and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, ""Ow! Ow! Ow!""--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!"
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"BUT the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,MR.
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"JEREMY bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"HE scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"""WHAT a mercy that was not a pike!"" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"""I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!"""
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"HE put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,"SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat, AND Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag."
the-tale-of-mr-jeremy-fisher,AND instead of a nice dish of minnows--they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!
