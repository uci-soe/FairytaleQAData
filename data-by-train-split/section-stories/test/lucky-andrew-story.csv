1,"There was once a rich peasant who had two sons, named John Nicholas and
Lucky Andrew. The oldest was one of those fellows of whom one never can
quite make head or tail. He was a most unpleasant customer to deal with,
and he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the Northland are,
as a rule, though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with
these attractive qualities. The other, Lucky Andrew, was wild and high
spirited, but always good natured, and no matter how badly off he might
be, he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star.
When the eagle, in order to defend his nest, belabored his head and face
till the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was born under a
lucky star, if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet. Did his
boat capsize, which occasionally happened, and did they discover him
hanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold and exertion, and
asked him how he felt, he would reply: ""O, quite well. I have been
saved. I surely am in luck!"""
2,"When their father died, both of them were of age, and not long after
they both had to go out to the sand-banks to fetch some fishing-nets,
which had been left there since the summer fishing. It was late in
the fall, after the time when most fishermen are busy with the summer
fishing. Andrew had his gun along, which he carried with him wherever he
went. John Nicholas did not say much while they were underway; but he
thought all the harder. They were not ready to set out for home again
until near evening."
3,"""Hark, Lucky Andrew, do you know there will be a storm to-night?"" said
John Nicholas, and looked out across the sea. ""I think it would be best
if we stayed here until morning!""

""There'll be no storm,"" said Andrew. ""The Seven Sisters have not put on
their fog-caps, so you may be quite at rest."""
4,"But his brother complained of being weary, and at length they decided to
remain there for the night. When Andrew awoke he found himself alone;
and he saw neither brother nor boat, until he came to the highest point
of the island. Then he discovered him far out, darting for land like a
sea-gull. Andrew did not understand the whole affair. There were still
provisions there, as well as a dish of curd, his gun and various other
things. So Andrew wasted but little time in thought. ""He will come back
this evening,"" said he. ""Only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat.""
But in the evening there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited
day by day, and week by week; until at last, he realized that his
brother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to
keep their inheritance for himself, and not have to divide it. And
such was the case, for when John Nicholas came in sight of land on his
homeward trip, he had capsized the boat, and declared that Lucky Andrew
had been drowned."
5,"But the latter did not lose heart. He gathered drift-wood along the
strand, shot sea-birds, and looked for mussels and roots. He built
himself a raft of drift-timber, and fished with a pole that had also
been left behind. One day, while he was at work, he happened to notice a
depression or hollow in the sand, as though made by the keel of a large
Northland schooner, and he could plainly trace the braidings of the
hawsers from the strand up to the top of the island. Then he thought to
himself that he was in no danger, for he saw there was truth in the
report he had often heard, that the meer-folk made the island their
abode, and did much business with their ships."
6,"""God be praised for good company! That was just what I needed. Yes, it
is true, as I have always said, that I was born under a lucky star,""
thought Andrew to himself; perhaps he said so too, for occasionally he
really had to talk a little. So he lived through the fall. Once he saw a
boat, and hung a rag on a pole and waved with it; but that very moment
the sail dropped, and the crew took to the oars and rowed away at top
speed, for they thought the meer-trolls were making signs and waving."
7,"On Christmas Eve Andrew heard fiddles and music far out at sea; and when
he came out, he saw a glow of light that came from a great Northland
schooner, which was gliding toward the land--yet such a ship he had
never yet seen. It has a main-sail of uncommon size, which looked to him
to be of silk, and the most delicate tackling, as thin as though woven
of steel wire, and everything else was in proportion, as fine and
handsome as any Northlander might wish to have. The whole schooner was
filled with little people dressed in blue, but the girl who stood at the
helm was adorned like a bride, and looked as splendid as a queen, for
she wore a crown and costly garments. Yet any one could see that she was
a human being, for she was tall, and handsomer than the meer-folk. In
fact, Lucky Andrew thought that she was handsomer than any girl he ever
had seen. The schooner headed for the land where Andrew stood; but with
his usual presence of mind, he hurried to the fisherman's hut, pulled
down his gun from the wall, and crept up into the large loft and hid
himself, so that he could see all that passed in the hut. He soon
noticed that the whole room was alive with people."
8,"They filled it completely and more, and still more of them came in. Then the walls
began to crack, and the little hut spread out at all corners, and grew
so splendid and magnificent that the wealthiest merchant could not have
had its equal; it was almost like being in a royal castle. Tables were
covered with the most exquisite silver and gold. When they had eaten
they began to dance. Under cover of the noise, Andrew crept to the
look-out at the side of the roof, and climbed down. Then he ran to the
schooner, threw his flint-stone over it, and in order to make certain,
cut a cross into it with his sharp-cutting knife. When he came back
again, the dance was in full swing. The tables were dancing and the
benches and chairs--everything else in the room was dancing, too. The
only one who did not dance was the bride; she only sat there and looked
on, and when the bridegroom came to fetch her, she sent him away. For
the moment there was no thought of stopping."
9,"The fiddler knew neither rest nor repose, and did not pass his cap, but played merrily on with his left hand, and beat time with his foot, until he was dripping with
sweat, and the fiddle was hidden by the dust and smoke. When Andrew
noticed that his own feet began to twitch where he was standing, he
thought to himself: ""Now I had better shoot away, or else he will play
me right off the ground!"" So he turned his gun, thrust it through the
window, and shot it off over the bride's head; but upside down,
otherwise the bullet would have hit him. The moment the shot crashed,
all the troll-folk tumbled out of the door together; but when they saw
that the schooner was banned on the shore, they wailed and crept into a
hole in the hill. But all the gold and silver dishes were left behind,
and the bride, too, was still sitting there. She told Lucky Andrew that
she had been carried into the hill when she was only a small child.
Once, when her mother had gone to the pen to attend to the milking, she
had taken her along; but when she had to go home for a moment, she left
the child sitting under a juniper-bush, and told her that she might eat
the berries if she only repeated three times:

      ""I eat juniper-berries blue,
      Wherein Jesu's cross I view.
      I eat whortle-berries red,
      Since 'twas for my sake He bled!"""
10,"But after her mother had gone, she found so many berries that she forgot
to say her verse, and so she was enchanted and taken into the hill. And
there no harm had been done her, save that she had lost the top joint of
the little finger of her left hand, and the goblins had been kind to
her; yet it had always seemed to her as though something were not as it
should be, she felt as though something weighed upon her, and she had
suffered greatly from the advances of the dwarf who had been chosen for
her husband. When Andrew learned who her mother and her people were, he
saw that they were related to him, and they became very good friends. So
Andrew could truly say he had been born under a lucky star. Then they
sailed home, and took along the schooner, and all the gold and silver,
and all the treasure which had been left in the hut, and then Andrew was
far wealthier than his brother."
11,"But the latter, who suspected where all this wealth had come from, did
not wish to be any poorer than Andrew. He knew that trolls and goblins
walk mainly on Christmas Eve, and for that reason he sailed out to the
sand banks at that time. And on Christmas Eve he did see a light or
fire, but it seemed to be like will-o'-the-wisps fluttering about. When
he came nearer he heard splashes, horrible howls, and cold, piercing
cries, and there was a smell of slime and sea-weed, as at ebb-tide.
Terrified, he ran up into the hut, from whence he could see the trolls
on the shore. They were short and thick like hay-ricks, completely
covered with fur, with kirtles of skins, fishing boots, and enormous
fist-gloves. In place of head and hair they had bundles of sea-weed.
When they crawled up from the strand there was a gleam behind them like
that of rotting wood, and when they shook themselves they showered
sparks about them. When they drew nearer, John Nicholas crawled up into
the loft as his brother had done. The goblins dragged a great stone into
the hut, and began to beat their gloves dry against it, and meanwhile
they screamed so that John Nicholas's blood turned to ice in his
hiding-place. Then one of them sneezed into the ashes on the hearth
in order to make the fire burn again; while the others carried in
heather-grass and drift-wood, as coarse and heavy as lead."
12,"The smoke and the heat nearly killed the eavesdropper in the loft, and in order to
catch his breath and get some fresh air, he tried to crawl out of the
look-out in the roof; yet he was of much heavier build than his brother,
stuck fast and could move neither in nor out. Then he grew frightened
and began to scream; but the goblins screamed much louder, and roared
and howled, and thumped and clamored inside and outside the hut. But
when the cock crowed they disappeared, and John Nicholas freed himself,
too. Yet when he returned home from his trip, he had lost his reason,
and after that the same cold, sinister screams which are the mark of the
troll in the Northland, might often be heard sounding from store-rooms
and lofts where he happened to be. Before his death, however, his reason
returned, and he was buried in consecrated ground, as they say. But
after that time no human foot ever trod the sand-banks again. They sank,
and the meer-folk, it is believed, went to the Lekang Islands. Andrew's
luck held good; no ship made more successful trips than his own; but
whenever he came to the Lekang Islands he lay becalmed--the goblins went
aboard or ashore with their goods--but after a time he had fair winds,
whether he happened to want to go to Bergen, or sail home. He had many
children, and all of them were bright and vigorous, yet every one of
them lacked the upper joint of the little finger of his left hand."
