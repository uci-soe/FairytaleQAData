1,"Far up in a green valley in the Island of Hoy stands an immense boulder.It is hollow inside, and the natives of these northern islands call itthe Dwarfie Stone, because long centuries ago, so the legend has it,Snorro the Dwarf lived there.Nobody knew where Snorro came from, or how long he had dwelt in the darkchamber inside the Dwarfie Stone. All that they knew about him was thathe was a little man, with a queer, twisted, deformed body and a face ofmarvellous beauty, which never seemed to look any older, but was alwayssmiling and young.Men said that this was because Snorro's father had been a Fairy, and nota denizen of earth, who had bequeathed to his son the gift of perpetualyouth, but nobody knew whether this were true or not, for the Dwarf hadinhabited the Dwarfie Stone long before the oldest man or woman in Hoyhad been born.One thing was certain, however: he had inherited from his mother, whomall men agreed had been mortal, the dangerous qualities of vanity andambition. And the longer he lived the more vain and ambitious did hebecome, until at last he always carried a mirror of polished steel roundhis neck, into which he constantly looked in order to see the reflectionof his handsome face."
2,"And he would not attend to the country people who came to seek his help,unless they bowed themselves humbly before him and spoke to him as if hewere a King.I say that the country people sought his help, for he spent his time, orappeared to spend it, in collecting herbs and simples on the hillsides,which he carried home with him to his dark abode, and distilledmedicines and potions from them, which he sold to his neighbours atwondrous high prices.He was also the possessor of a wonderful leathern-covered book, claspedwith clasps of brass, over which he would pore for hours together, andout of which he would tell the simple Islanders their fortunes, if theywould.For they feared the book almost as much as they feared Snorro himself,for it was whispered that it had once belonged to Odin, and they crossedthemselves for protection as they named the mighty Enchanter."
3,"But all the time they never guessed the real reason why Snorro chose tolive in the Dwarfie Stone.I will tell you why he did so. Not very far from the Stone there was acurious hill, shaped exactly like a wart. It was known as the Wart Hillof Hoy, and men said that somewhere in the side of it was hidden awonderful carbuncle, which, when it was found, would bestow on itsfinder marvellous magic gifts--Health, Wealth, and Happiness.Everything, in fact, that a human being could desire.And the curious thing about this carbuncle was, that it was said that itcould be seen at certain times, if only the people who were looking forit were at the right spot at the right moment.Now Snorro had made up his mind that he would find this wonderful stone,so, while he pretended to spend all his time in reading his great bookor distilling medicines from his herbs, he was really keeping a keenlook-out during his wanderings, noting every tuft of grass or piece ofrock under which it might be hidden. And at night, when everyone elsewas asleep, he would creep out, with pickaxe and spade, to turn over therocks or dig over the turf, in the hope of finding the long-sought-fortreasure underneath them."
4,"He was always accompanied on these occasions by an enormous grey-headed Raven, who lived in the cave along with him, and who was his bosom friend and companion. The Islanders feared this bird of ill omen asmuch, perhaps, as they feared its Master; for, although they went toconsult Snorro in all their difficulties and perplexities, and boughtmedicines and love-potions from him, they always looked upon him with acertain dread, feeling that there was something weird and uncanny abouthim.Now, at the time we are speaking of, Orkney was governed by two Earls,who were half-brothers. Paul, the elder, was a tall, handsome man, withdark hair, and eyes like sloes. All the country people loved him, for hewas so skilled in knightly exercises, and had such a sweet and lovingnature, that no one could help being fond of him. Old people's eyeswould brighten at the sight of him, and the little children would runout to greet him as he rode by their mothers' doors.And this was the more remarkable because, with all his winning manner,he had such a lack of conversation that men called him Paul the Silent,or Paul the Taciturn."
5,"Harold, on the other hand, was as different from his brother as night isfrom day. He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, and he had gained forhimself the name of Harold the Orator, because he was always free ofspeech and ready with his tongue.But for all this he was not a favourite. For he was haughty, andjealous, and quick-tempered, and the old folks' eyes did not brighten atthe sight of him, and the babes, instead of toddling out to greet him,hid their faces in their mothers' skirts when they saw him coming.Harold could not help knowing that the people liked his silent brotherbest, and the knowledge made him jealous of him, so a coldness sprang upbetween them.Now it chanced, one summer, that Earl Harold went on a visit to the Kingof Scotland, accompanied by his mother, the Countess Helga, and hersister, the Countess Fraukirk."
6,"And while he was at Court he met a charming young Irish lady, the LadyMorna, who had come from Ireland to Scotland to attend upon the ScottishQueen. She was so sweet, and good, and gentle that Earl Harold's heartwas won, and he made up his mind that she, and only she, should be hisbride.But although he had paid her much attention, Lady Morna had sometimescaught glimpses of his jealous temper; she had seen an evil expressionin his eyes, and had heard him speak sharply to his servants, and shehad no wish to marry him. So, to his great amazement, she refused thehonour which he offered her, and told him that she would prefer toremain as she was.Earl Harold ground his teeth in silent rage, but he saw that it was nouse pressing his suit at that moment. So what he could not obtain by hisown merits he determined to obtain by guile.Accordingly he begged his mother to persuade the Lady Morna to go backwith them on a visit, hoping that when she was alone with him in Orkney,he would be able to overcome her prejudice against him, and induce herto become his wife. And all the while he never remembered his brotherPaul; or, if he did, he never thought it possible that he could be hisrival."
7,"But that was just the very thing that happened. The Lady Morna, thinking
no evil, accepted the Countess Helga's invitation, and no sooner had the
party arrived back in Orkney than Paul, charmed with the grace and
beauty of the fair Irish Maiden, fell head over ears in love with her.
And the Lady Morna, from the very first hour that she saw him, returned
his love.

Of course this state of things could not long go on hidden, and when
Harold realised what had happened his anger and jealousy knew no bounds.
Seizing a dagger, he rushed up to the turret where his brother was
sitting in his private apartments, and threatened to stab him to the
heart if he did not promise to give up all thoughts of winning the
lovely stranger.

But Paul met him with pleasant words.

""Calm thyself, Brother,"" he said. ""It is true that I love the lady, but
that is no proof that I shall win her. Is it likely that she will choose
me, whom all men name Paul the Silent, when she hath the chance of
marrying you, whose tongue moves so swiftly that to you is given the
proud title of Harold the Orator?"""
8,"At these words Harold's vanity was flattered, and he thought that, afterall, his step-brother was right, and that he had a very small chance,with his meagre gift of speech, of being successful in his suit. So hethrew down his dagger, and, shaking hands with him, begged him topardon his unkind thoughts, and went down the winding stair again inhigh good-humour with himself and all the world.By this time it was coming near to the Feast of Yule, and at thatFestival it was the custom for the Earl and his Court to leave Kirkwallfor some weeks, and go to the great Palace of Orphir, nine milesdistant. And in order to see that everything was ready, Earl Paul tookhis departure some days before the others.The evening before he left he chanced to find the Lady Morna sittingalone in one of the deep windows of the great hall. She had beenweeping, for she was full of sadness at the thought of his departure;and at the sight of her distress the kind-hearted young Earl could nolonger contain himself, but, folding her in his arms, he whispered toher how much he loved her, and begged her to promise to be his wife."
9,"She agreed willingly. Hiding her rosy face on his shoulder, sheconfessed that she had loved him from the very first day that she hadseen him; and ever since that moment she had determined that, if shecould not wed him, she would wed no other man.For a little time they sat together, rejoicing in their new-foundhappiness. Then Earl Paul sprang to his feet.""Let us go and tell the good news to my mother and my brother,"" he said.""Harold may be disappointed at first, for I know, Sweetheart, he wouldfain have had thee for his own. But his good heart will soon overcomeall that, and he will rejoice with us also.""But the Lady Morna shook her head. She knew, better than her lover, whatEarl Harold's feeling would be; and she would fain put off the evilhour."
10,"""Let us hold our peace till after Yule,"" she pleaded. ""It will be a joyto keep our secret to ourselves for a little space; there will be timeenough then to let all the world know.""Rather reluctantly, Earl Paul agreed; and next day he set off for thePalace at Orphir, leaving his lady-love behind him.Little he guessed the danger he was in! For, all unknown to him, hisstep-aunt, Countess Fraukirk, had chanced to be in the hall, the eveningbefore, hidden behind a curtain, and she had overheard every word thatMorna and he had spoken, and her heart was filled with black rage.For she was a hard, ambitious woman, and she had always hated the youngEarl, who was no blood-relation to her, and who stood in the way of hisbrother, her own nephew; for, if Paul were only dead, Harold would bethe sole Earl of Orkney.And now that he had stolen the heart of the Lady Morna, whom her ownnephew loved, her hate and anger knew no bounds. She had hastened off toher sister's chamber as soon as the lovers had parted; and there the twowomen had remained talking together till the chilly dawn broke in thesky."
11,"Countess Fraukirk ... hidden behind a curtain ... overheard every
word.]

Next day a boat went speeding over the narrow channel of water that
separates Pomona (on the mainland) from Hoy. In it sat a woman, but who
she was, or what she was like, no one could say, for she was covered
from head to foot with a black cloak, and her face was hidden behind a
thick, dark veil.

Snorro the Dwarf knew her, even before she laid aside her trappings, for
Countess Fraukirk was no stranger to him. In the course of her long life
she had often had occasion to seek his aid to help her in her evil
deeds, and she had always paid him well for his services in yellow gold.
He therefore welcomed her gladly; but when he had heard the nature of
her errand his smiling face grew grave again, and he shook his head.

""I have served thee well, Lady, in the past,"" he said, ""but methinks
that this thing goeth beyond my courage. For to compass an Earl's death
is a weighty matter, especially when he is so well beloved as is the
Earl Paul.""

""Thou knowest why I have taken up my abode in this lonely spot--how I
hope some day to light upon the magic carbuncle. Thou knowest also how
the people fear me, and hate me too, forsooth. And if the young Earl
died, and suspicion fell on me, I must needs fly the Island, for my life
would not be worth a grain of sand. Then my chance of success would be
gone. Nay! I cannot do it, Lady; I cannot do it."""
12,"But the wily Countess offered him much gold, and bribed him higher andhigher, first with wealth, then with success, and lastly she promised toobtain for him a high post at the Court of the King of Scotland; and atthat his ambition stirred within him, his determination gave way, and heconsented to do what she asked.""I will summon my magic loom,"" he said, ""and weave a piece of cloth offinest texture and of marvellous beauty; and before I weave it I will sopoison the thread with a magic potion that, when it is fashioned into agarment, whoever puts it on will die ere he hath worn it many minutes.""""Thou art a clever knave,"" answered the Countess, a cruel smile lightingup her evil face, ""and thou shalt be rewarded. Let me have a couple ofyards of this wonderful web, and I will make a bonnie waistcoat for myfine young Earl and give it to him as a Yuletide gift. Then I reckonthat he will not see the year out.""""That will he not,"" said Dwarf Snorro, with a malicious grin; and thetwo parted, after arranging that the piece of cloth should be deliveredat the Palace of Orphir on the day before Christmas Eve."
13,"Now, when the Countess Fraukirk had been away upon her wicked errand,strange things were happening at the Castle at Kirkwall. For Harold,encouraged by his brother's absence, offered his heart and hand oncemore to the Lady Morna. Once more she refused him, and in order to makesure that the scene should not be repeated, she told him that she hadplighted her troth to his brother. When he heard that this was so, rageand fury were like to devour him. Mad with anger, he rushed from herpresence, flung himself upon his horse, and rode away in the directionof the sea shore.While he was galloping wildly along, his eyes fell on the snow-cladhills of Hoy rising up across the strip of sea that divided the oneisland from the other. And his thoughts flew at once to Snorro theDwarf, who he had had occasion, as well as his step-aunt, to visit inbygone days.""I have it,"" he cried. ""Stupid fool that I was not to think of it atonce. I will go to Snorro, and buy from him a love-potion, which willmake my Lady Morna hate my precious brother and turn her thoughts kindlytowards me."""
14,"So he made haste to hire a boat, and soon he was speeding over thetossing waters on his way to the Island of Hoy. When he arrived there hehurried up the lonely valley to where the Dwarfie Stone stood, and hehad no difficulty in finding its uncanny occupant, for Snorro wasstanding at the hole that served as a door, his raven on his shoulder,gazing placidly at the setting sun.A curious smile crossed his face when, hearing the sound of approachingfootsteps, he turned round and his eyes fell on the young noble.""What bringeth thee here, Sir Earl?"" he asked gaily, for he scented moregold.""I come for a love-potion,"" said Harold; and without more ado he toldthe whole story to the Wizard. ""I will pay thee for it,"" he added, ""ifthou wilt give it to me quickly.""Snorro looked at him from head to foot. ""Blind must the maiden be, SirOrator,"" he said, ""who needeth a love-potion to make her fancy sogallant a Knight.""Earl Harold laughed angrily. ""It is easier to catch a sunbeam than awoman's roving fancy,"" he replied. ""I have no time for jesting. For,hearken, old man, there is a proverb that saith, 'Time and tide wait forno man,' so I need not expect the tide to wait for me. The potion I musthave, and that instantly."""
15,"Snorro saw that he was in earnest, so without a word he entered hisdwelling, and in a few minutes returned with a small phial in his hand,which was full of a rosy liquid.""Pour the contents of this into the Lady Morna's wine-cup,"" he said,""and I warrant thee that before four-and-twenty hours have passed shewill love thee better than thou lovest her now.""Then he waved his hand, as if to dismiss his visitor, and disappearedinto his dwelling-place.Earl Harold made all speed back to the Castle; but it was not until oneor two days had elapsed that he found a chance to pour the love-potioninto the Lady Morna's wine-cup. But at last, one night at supper, hefound an opportunity of doing so, and, waving away the little page-boy,he handed it to her himself."
16,"She raised it to her lips, but she only made a pretence at drinking, forshe had seen the hated Earl fingering the cup, and she feared some deedof treachery. When he had gone back to his seat she managed to pour thewhole of the wine on the floor, and smiled to herself at the look ofsatisfaction that came over Harold's face as she put down the emptycup.His satisfaction increased, for from that moment she felt so afraid ofhim that she treated him with great kindness, hoping that by doing soshe would keep in his good graces until the Court moved to Orphir, andher own true love could protect her.Harold, on his side, was delighted with her graciousness, for he feltcertain that the charm was beginning to work, and that his hopes wouldsoon be fulfilled.A week later the Court removed to the Royal Palace at Orphir, where EarlPaul had everything in readiness for the reception of his guests."
17,"Of course he was overjoyed to meet Lady Morna again, and she wasoverjoyed to meet him, for she felt that she was now safe from theunwelcome attentions of Earl Harold.But to Earl Harold the sight of their joy was as gall and bitterness,and he could scarcely contain himself, although he still trusted in theefficacy of Snorro the Dwarf's love-potion.As for Countess Fraukirk and Countess Helga, they looked forward eagerlyto the time when the magic web would arrive, out of which they hoped tofashion a fatal gift for Earl Paul.At last, the day before Christmas Eve, the two wicked women were sittingin the Countess Helga's chamber talking of the time when Earl Haroldwould rule alone in Orkney, when a tap came to the window, and onlooking round they saw Dwarf Snorro's grey-headed Raven perched on thesill, a sealed packet in its beak."
18,"They opened the casement, and with a hoarse croak the creature let the
packet drop on to the floor; then it flapped its great wings and rose
slowly into the air again its head turned in the direction of Hoy.

With fingers that trembled with excitement they broke the seals and
undid the packet. It contained a piece of the most beautiful material
that anyone could possibly imagine, woven in all the colours of the
rainbow, and sparkling with gold and jewels.

""Twill make a bonnie waistcoat,"" exclaimed Countess Fraukirk, with an
unholy laugh. ""The Silent Earl will be a braw man when he gets it on.""

Then, without more ado, they set to work to cut out and sew the garment.
All that night they worked, and all next day, till, late in the
afternoon, when they were putting in the last stitches, hurried
footsteps were heard ascending the winding staircase, and Earl Harold
burst open the door."
19,"His cheeks were red with passion, and his eyes were bright, for he couldnot but notice that, now that she was safe at Orphir under her truelove's protection, the Lady Morna's manner had grown cold and distantagain, and he was beginning to lose faith in Snorro's charm.Angry and disappointed, he had sought his mother's room to pour out hisstory of vexation to her.He stopped short, however, when he saw the wonderful waistcoat lying onthe table, all gold and silver and shining colours. It was like a fairygarment, and its beauty took his breath away."
20,"""For whom hast thou purchased that?"" he asked, hoping to hear that it
was intended for him.

""Tis a Christmas gift for thy brother Paul,"" answered his mother, and
she would have gone on to tell him how deadly a thing it was, had he
given her time to speak. But her words fanned his fury into madness, for
it seemed to him that this hated brother of his was claiming everything.

""Everything is for Paul! I am sick of his very name,"" he cried. ""By my
troth, he shall not have this!"" and he snatched the vest from the table.

It was in vain that his mother and his aunt threw themselves at his
feet, begging him to lay it down, and warning him that there was not a
thread in it which was not poisoned. He paid no heed to their words, but
rushed from the room, and, drawing it on, ran downstairs with a reckless
laugh, to show the Lady Morna how fine he was."
21,"Alas! alas! Scarce had he gained the hall than he fell to the ground in
great pain.

Everyone crowded round him, and the two Countesses, terrified now by
what they had done, tried in vain to tear the magic vest from his body.
But he felt that it was too late, the deadly poison had done its work,
and, waving them aside, he turned to his brother, who, in great
distress, had knelt down and taken him tenderly in his arms.

""I wronged thee, Paul,"" he gasped. ""For thou hast ever been true and
kind. Forgive me in thy thoughts, and,"" he added, gathering up his
strength for one last effort, and pointing to the two wretched women who
had wrought all this misery, ""_Beware of those two women_, for they
seek to take thy life."" Then his head sank back on his brother's
shoulder, and, with one long sigh, he died.

When he learned what had happened, and understood where the waistcoat
came from, and for what purpose it had been intended, the anger of the
Silent Earl knew no bounds. He swore a great oath that he would be
avenged, not only on Snorro the Dwarf, but also on his wicked
step-mother and her cruel sister."
22,"His vengeance was baulked, however, for in the panic and confusion that
followed Harold's death, the two Countesses slipped out of the Palace
and fled to the coast, and took boat in haste to Scotland, where they
had great possessions, and where they were much looked up to, and where
no one would believe a word against them.

But retribution fell on them in the end, as it always does fall, sooner
or later, on everyone who is wicked, or selfish, or cruel; for the
Norsemen invaded the land, and their Castle was set on fire, and they
perished miserably in the flames.

When Earl Paul found that they had escaped, he set out in hot haste for
the Island of Hoy, for he was determined that the Dwarf, at least,
should not escape. But when he came to the Dwarfie Stone he found it
silent and deserted, all trace of its uncanny occupants having
disappeared."
23,"No one knew what had become of them; a few people were inclined to think that the Dwarf and his Raven had accompanied the Countess Fraukirk and the Countess Helga on their flight, but the greater part of the
Islanders held to the belief, which I think was the true one, that the
Powers of the Air spirited Snorro away, and shut him up in some unknown
place as a punishment for his wickedness, and that his Raven accompanied
him.

At any rate, he was never seen again by any living person, and wherever
he went, he lost all chance of finding the magic carbuncle.

As for the Silent Earl and his Irish Sweetheart, they were married as
soon as Earl Harold's funeral was over; and for hundreds of years
afterwards, when the inhabitants of the Orkney Isles wanted to express
great happiness, they said, ""As happy as Earl Paul and the Countess
Morna."""
