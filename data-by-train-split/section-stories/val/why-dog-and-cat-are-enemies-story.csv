1,"Once upon a time there was a man and his wife and they had a ring ofgold. It was a lucky ring, and whoever owned it always had enough tolive on. But this they did not know, and hence sold the ring for asmall sum. But no sooner was the ring gone than they began to growpoorer and poorer, and at last did not know when they would get theirnext meal. They had a dog and a cat, and these had to go hungry aswell. Then the two animals took counsel together as to how they mightrestore to their owners their former good fortune. At length the doghit upon an idea."
2,"""They must have the ring back again,"" he said to the cat.The cat answered: ""The ring has been carefully locked up in thechest, where no one can get at it.""""You must catch a mouse,"" said the dog, ""and the mouse must gnaw ahole in the chest and fetch out the ring. And if she does not want to,say that you will bite her to death, and you will see that she will doit."""
3,"This advice pleased the cat, and she caught a mouse. Then she wantedto go to the house in which stood the chest, and the dog came after.They came to a broad river. And since the cat could not swim, the dogtook her on his back and swam across with her. Then the cat carriedthe mouse to the house in which the chest stood. The mouse gnawed ahole in the chest, and fetched out the ring. The cat put the ring inher mouth and went back to the river, where the dog was waiting forher, and swam across with her. Then they started out together forhome, in order to bring the lucky ring to their master and mistress.But the dog could only run along the ground; when there was a house inthe way he always had to go around it. The cat, however, quicklyclimbed over the roof, and so she reached home long before the dog,and brought the ring to her master."
4,"Then her master said to his wife: ""What a good creature the cat is! Wewill always give her enough to eat and care for her as though she wereour own child!""But when the dog came home they beat him and scolded him, because hehad not helped to bring home the ring again. And the cat sat by thefireplace, purred and said never a word. Then the dog grew angry atthe cat, because she had robbed him of his reward, and when he saw herhe chased her and tried to seize her.And ever since that day cat and dog are enemies."
