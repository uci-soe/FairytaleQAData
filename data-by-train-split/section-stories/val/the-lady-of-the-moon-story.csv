1,"In the days of the Emperor Yau lived a prince by the name of Hou I,who was a mighty hero and a good archer. Once ten suns rose togetherin the sky, and shone so brightly and burned so fiercely that thepeople on earth could not endure them. So the Emperor ordered Hou I toshoot at them. And Hou I shot nine of them down from the sky. Besideshis bow, Hou I also had a horse which ran so swiftly that even thewind could not catch up with it."
2,"He mounted it to go a-hunting, andthe horse ran away and could not be stopped. So Hou I came to KunlunMountain and met the Queen-Mother of the Jasper Sea. And she gave himthe herb of immortality. He took it home with him and hid it in hisroom. But his wife who was named Tschang O, once ate some of it on thesly when he was not at home, and she immediately floated up to theclouds. When she reached the moon, she ran into the castle there, andhas lived there ever since as the Lady of the Moon."
3,"On a night in mid-autumn, an emperor of the Tang dynasty once sat atwine with two sorcerers. And one of them took his bamboo staff andcast it into the air, where it turned into a heavenly bridge, on whichthe three climbed up to the moon together. There they saw a greatcastle on which was inscribed: ""The Spreading Halls of Crystal Cold.""Beside it stood a cassia tree which blossomed and gave forth afragrance filling all the air. And in the tree sat a man who waschopping off the smaller boughs with an ax."
4,"One of the sorcerers said:""That is the man in the moon. The cassia tree grows so luxuriantlythat in the course of time it would overshadow all the moon'sradiance. Therefore it has to be cut down once in every thousandyears."" Then they entered the spreading halls. The silver stories ofthe castle towered one above the other, and its walls and columns wereall formed of liquid crystal. In the walls were cages and ponds, wherefishes and birds moved as though alive. The whole moon-world seemedmade of glass. While they were still looking about them on all sidesthe Lady of the Moon stepped up to them, clad in a white mantle and arainbow-colored gown."
5,"She smiled and said to the emperor: ""You are aprince of the mundane world of dust. Great is your fortune, since youhave been able to find your way here!"" And she called for herattendants, who came flying up on white birds, and sang and dancedbeneath the cassia tree. A pure clear music floated through the air.Beside the tree stood a mortar made of white marble, in which a jasperrabbit ground up herbs. That was the dark half of the moon. When thedance had ended, the emperor returned to earth again with thesorcerers. And he had the songs which he had heard on the moon writtendown and sung to the accompaniment of flutes of jasper in hispear-tree garden."
