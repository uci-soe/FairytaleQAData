1,"Once upon a time there was a man who had a cat, and she ate so very
much that he did not want to keep her any longer. So he decided to tie
a stone around her neck, and throw her into the river; but before he
did so she was to have something to eat just once more. The woman
offered her a dish of mush and a little potful of fat. These she
swallowed, and then jumped out of the window. There stood the man on
the threshing-floor."
2,"""Good-day, man in the house,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat,"" said the man. ""Have you had anything to eat yet
to-day?""

""O, only a little, but my fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat, and I
am thinking over whether I ought not to eat you as well,"" said she, and
she seized the man and ate him up. Then she went into the stable. There
sat the woman, milking.

""Good-day, woman in the stable,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat, is that you?"" said the woman. ""Have you eaten your
food?"" she asked.

""O, only a little to-day. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat.
""I have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and
the man in the house, and I'm thinking over whether I ought not to eat
you as well,"" said she, and she seized the woman and ate her up.

""Good-day, cow at the manger,"" said the cat to the bell-cow."
3,"""Good-day, cat,"" said the bell-cow. ""Have you had anything to eat yet
to-day?"" ""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the
cat. ""I have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat
and the man in the house and the woman in the stable, and I'm thinking
over whether I ought not to eat you as well,"" said the cat, and seized
the bell-cow and ate her up. Then she went up to the orchard, and there
stood a man who was sweeping up leaves.

""Good-day, leaf-sweeper in the orchard,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat,"" said the man. ""Have you had anything to eat yet
to-day?""

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger, and I'm thinking over whether I ought not to eat you up as
well,"" said she, and seized the leaf-sweeper and ate him up."
4,"Then she came to a stone-pile. There stood the weasel, looking about
him.

""Good-day, weasel on the stone-pile,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat,"" said the weasel. ""Have you had anything to eat yet
to-day?""

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard, and I'm thinking over
whether I ought not to eat you as well,"" said the cat, and seized the
weasel and ate him up."
5,"After she had gone a while, she came to a hazel-bush. There sat the
squirrel, gathering nuts.

""Good-day, squirrel in the bush,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you already had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said
the squirrel.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the
stone-pile, and I'm thinking over whether I ought not to eat you up as
well,"" said she, and seized the squirrel and ate him up."
6,"After she had gone a little while longer, she met Reynard the fox, who
was peeping out of the edge of the forest.

""Good-day, fox, you sly-boots,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the fox.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the
stone-pile and the squirrel in the hazel-bush, and I'm thinking over
whether I ought not to eat you as well,"" said she, and seized the fox
and ate him up too."
7,"When she had gone a little further, she met a hare.

""Good-day, you hopping hare,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the hare.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the
stone-pile and the squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the
sly-boots, and I'm thinking over whether I ought not to eat you up as
well,"" said she, and seized the hare and ate him up."
8,"When she had gone a little further, she met a wolf.

""Good-day, you wild wolf,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the wolf.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the
stone-pile and the squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the
sly-boots, and the hopping hare, and I'm thinking over whether I ought
not to eat you up as well,"" said she, and seized the wolf and ate him
up, too."
9,"Then she went into the wood, and when she had gone far and farther than
far, over hill and dale, she met a young bear.

""Good-day, little bear brown-coat,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the bear.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little pot of fat and the man
in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the manger
and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the stone-pile and
the squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and the
hopping hare and the wild wolf, and I'm thinking over whether I ought
not to eat you up as well,"" said she, and seized the little bear and ate
him up."
10,"When the cat had gone a bit further, she met the mother bear, who was
clawing at the tree-stems so that the bark flew, so angry was she to
have lost her little one.

""Good-day, you biting mother bear,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the
mother bear.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the
stone-pile and the squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the
sly-boots, and the hopping hare and the wild wolf and the little bear
brown-coat, and I'm thinking over whether I ought not to eat you as
well,"" said she, and seized the mother bear and ate her, too."
11,"When the cat had gone on a little further, she met the bear himself.

""Good-day, Bruin Good-fellow,"" said she.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" asked the
bear.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel in the
stone-pile and the squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the
sly-boots, and the hopping hare and the wild wolf and the little bear
brown-coat and the biting mother bear, and now I'm thinking over whether
I ought not to eat you as well,"" said she, and she seized the bear and
ate him up, too."
12,"Then the cat went far and farther than far, until she came into the
parish. And there she met a bridal party on the road.

""Good-day, bridal party on the road,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?""

""O, only a little. My fast is hardly broken,"" said the cat. ""I have had
no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the man in
the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the manger and
the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the stone-pile and the
squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and the hopping
hare and the wild wolf and the little bear brown-coat and the biting
mother bear and bruin good-fellow and now I'm thinking whether I ought
not to eat you up as well,"" said she, and she pounced on the whole
bridal party, and ate it up, with the cook, the musicians, the horses
and all."
13,"When she had gone a bit farther, she came to the church. And there she
met a funeral procession.

""Good-day, funeral procession at the church,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the
funeral procession.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and
the man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at
the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the
stone-pile and the squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the
sly-boots, and the hopping hare and the wild wolf and little bear
brown-coat and the biting mother bear and bruin good-fellow and the
bridal party on the road, and now I'm thinking over whether I ought
not to eat you up as well,"" said she, and pounced on the funeral
procession, and ate up corpse and procession."
14,"When the cat had swallowed it all, she went straight on up to the sky,
and when she had gone far and farther than far, she met the moon in a
cloud.

""Good-day, moon in a cloud,"" said the cat.

""Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the moon.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the
stone-pile and the squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the
sly-boots, and the wild wolf and little bear brown-coat and the biting
mother bear and bruin good-fellow and the bridal party on the road and
the funeral procession at the church, and now I'm thinking over whether
I ought not to eat you up as well,"" said she, and pounced on the moon
and ate him up, half and full."
15,"Then the cat went far and farther than far, and met the sun.

""Good morning, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the
sun.

""O, only a little,"" said the cat. ""I have had no more than a dish of
mush and a little potful of fat and the man in the house and the woman
in the stable and the bell-cow at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the
orchard and the weasel on the stone-pile and the squirrel in the
hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and the hopping hare and the wild
wolf and little bear brown-coat and the biting mother bear and bruin
good-fellow and the bridal party on the road and the funeral procession
at the church and the moon in a cloud, and now I'm thinking over whether
I ought not to eat you up as well,"" said she, and pounced on the sun in
the sky and ate him up."
16,"Then the cat went far and farther than far, until she came to a bridge,
and there she met a large billy-goat.

""Good morning, billy-goat on the broad bridge,"" said the cat.

""Good morning, cat! Have you had anything to eat yet to-day?"" said the
goat.

""O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,"" said the cat. ""I had
no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the man in
the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the manger and
the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the stone-pile and the
squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and the hopping
hare and the wild wolf and little bear brown-coat and the biting mother
bear and bruin good-fellow and the bridal party on the road and the
funeral procession at the church and the moon in a cloud and the sun in
the sky, and now I'm thinking over whether I ought not to eat you up as
well,"" said she."
17,"""We'll fight about that first of all,"" said the goat, and butted the cat
with his horns so that she rolled off the bridge, and fell into the
water, and there she burst.

Then they all crawled out, and each went to his own place, all whom the
cat had eaten up, and were every one of them as lively as before, the
man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the
stone-pile and the squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the
sly-boots, and the hopping hare and the wild wolf and little bear
brown-coat and the biting mother bear and bruin good-fellow and the
bridal party on the road and the funeral procession at the church and
the moon in a cloud and the sun in the sky."
