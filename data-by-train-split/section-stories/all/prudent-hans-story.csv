Hans answered, ""To Grethel's, mother."" 
""Manage well, Hans."" 
""All right! Good-bye, mother."" 
""Good-bye, Hans."" Then Hans came to Grethel's. ""Good morning, Grethel."" 
""Good morning, Hans. What have you brought me to-day?"" 
""I have brought nothing, but I want something."" 
So Grethel gave Hans a needle; and then he said, ""Good-bye, Grethel,"" and she said, ""Good-bye, Hans.""  Hans carried the needle away with him, and stuck it in a hay-cart that was going along, and he followed it home. 
""Good evening, mother."" 
""Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?"" 
""To Grethel's, mother."" 
""What did you take her?"" 
""I took nothing, but I brought away something."" 
""What did Grethel give you?"" 
""A needle, mother."" 
""What did you do with it, Hans?"" 
""Stuck it in the hay-cart."" 
""That was very stupid of you, Hans. You should have stuck it in your sleeve."" 
""All right, mother! I'll do better next time."""

""What did Grethel give you, Hans?"" 
""A knife, mother."" 
""What did you do with it, Hans?"" 
""Stuck it in my sleeve, mother."" 
""That was very stupid of you, Hans. You should have put it in your pocket."" 
""All right, mother! I'll do better next time."""

""What did Grethel give you, Hans?"" 
""A goat, mother."" 
""What did you do with it, Hans?""

So Grethel gave Hans a piece of bacon. Then he said, ""Good-bye, Grethel."" 
She said, ""Good-bye, Hans."" 
Hans took the bacon, and tied a string round it, and dragged it after him on his way home, and the dogs came and ate it up, so that when he got home he had the string in his hand, and nothing at the other end of it.

""That was very stupid of you, Hans. You ought to have carried it on your head."" 
""All right! I'll do better next time, mother."""

""A calf, mother."" 
""What did you do with the calf, Hans?""

Then Grethel said to Hans, 
""You shall take away me."" 
Then Hans took Grethel, and tied a rope round her neck, and led her home, and fastened her up to the manger, and went to his mother. 
""Good evening, mother."" 
""Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?"" 
""To Grethel's, mother."" 
""What did you take her, Hans?"" 
""Nothing, mother."" 
""What did Grethel give you, Hans?"" 
""Nothing but herself, mother."" 
""Where have you left Grethel, Hans?"" 
""I led her home with a rope, and tied her up to the manger to eat hay, mother."" 
""That was very stupid of you, Hans. You should have cast sheep's eyes at her."" 
""All right, mother! I'll do better next time."" 
Then Hans went into the stable, and taking all the eyes out of the sheep, he threw them in Grethel's face. Then Grethel was angry, and getting loose, she ran away and became the bride of another."
