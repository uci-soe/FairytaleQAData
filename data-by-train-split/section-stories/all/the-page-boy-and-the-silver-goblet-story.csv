1,"There was once a little page-boy, who was in service in a statelyCastle. He was a very good-natured little fellow, and did his duties sowillingly and well that everybody liked him, from the great Earl whom heserved every day on bended knee, to the fat old butler whose errands heran.Now the Castle stood on the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea, andalthough the walls at that side were very thick, in them there was alittle postern door, which opened on to a narrow flight of steps thatled down the face of the cliff to the sea shore, so that anyone wholiked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe inthe shimmering sea.On the other side of the Castle were gardens and pleasure grounds,opening on to a long stretch of heather-covered moorland, which, atlast, met a distant range of hills."
2,"The little page-boy was very fond of going out on this moor when hiswork was done, for then he could run about as much as he liked, chasingbumble-bees, and catching butterflies, and looking for birds' nests whenit was nesting time.And the old butler was very pleased that he should do so, for he knewthat it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in theopen air. But before the boy went out the old man always gave him onewarning.""Now, mind my words, laddie, and keep far away from the Fairy Knowe, forthe Little Folk are not to trust to."""
3,"This Knowe of which he spoke was a little green hillock, which stood onthe moor not twenty yards from the garden gate, and folk said that itwas the abode of Fairies, who would punish any rash mortal who came toonear them. And because of this the country people would walk a goodhalf-mile out of their way, even in broad daylight, rather than run therisk of going too near the Fairy Knowe and bringing down the LittleFolks' displeasure upon them. And at night they would hardly cross themoor at all, for everyone knows that Fairies come abroad in thedarkness, and the door of their dwelling stands open, so that anyluckless mortal who does not take care may find himself inside.Now, the little page-boy was an adventurous wight, and instead of beingfrightened of the Fairies, he was very anxious to see them, and to visittheir abode, just to find out what it was like."
4,"So one night, when everyone else was asleep, he crept out of the Castleby the little postern door, and stole down the stone steps, and alongthe sea shore, and up on to the moor, and went straight to the FairyKnowe.To his delight he found that what everyone said was true. The top of theKnowe was tipped up, and from the opening that was thus made, rays oflight came streaming out.His heart was beating fast with excitement, but, gathering his courage,he stooped down and slipped inside the Knowe."
5,"He found himself in a large room lit by numberless tiny candles, andthere, seated round a polished table, were scores of the Tiny Folk,Fairies, and Elves, and Gnomes, dressed in green, and yellow, and pink;blue, and lilac, and scarlet; in all the colours, in fact, that you canthink of.He stood in a dark corner watching the busy scene in wonder, thinkinghow strange it was that there should be such a number of these tinybeings living their own lives all unknown to men, at such a littledistance from them, when suddenly someone--he could not tell who itwas--gave an order.""Fetch the Cup,"" cried the owner of the unknown voice, and instantly twolittle Fairy pages, dressed all in scarlet livery, darted from the tableto a tiny cupboard in the rock, and returned staggering under the weightof a most beautiful silver cup, richly embossed and lined inside withgold."
6,"He placed it in the middle of the table, and, amid clapping of hands andshouts of joy, all the Fairies began to drink out of it in turn. Andthe page could see, from where he stood, that no one poured wine intoit, and yet it was always full, and that the wine that was in it was notalways the same kind, but that each Fairy, when he grasped its stem,wished for the wine that he loved best, and lo! in a moment the cup wasfull of it.""Twould be a fine thing if I could take that cup home with me,"" thoughtthe page. ""No one will believe that I have been here except I havesomething to show for it."" So he bided his time, and watched."
7,"Presently the Fairies noticed him, and, instead of being angry at hisboldness in entering their abode, as he expected that they would be,they seemed very pleased to see him, and invited him to a seat at thetable. But by and by they grew rude and insolent, and jeered at him forbeing content to serve mere mortals, telling him that they saweverything that went on at the Castle, and making fun of the old butler,whom the page loved with all his heart. And they laughed at the food heate, saying that it was only fit for animals; and when any fresh daintywas set on the table by the scarlet-clad pages, they would push the dishacross to him, saying: ""Taste it, for you will not have the chance oftasting such things at the Castle.""At last he could stand their teasing remarks no longer; besides, he knewthat if he wanted to secure the cup he must lose no time in doing so.So he suddenly stood up, and grasped the stem of it tightly in his hand.""I'll drink to you all in water,"" he cried, and instantly the ruby winewas turned to clear cold water."
8,"He raised the cup to his lips, but he did not drink from it. With asudden jerk he threw the water over the candles, and instantly the roomwas in darkness. Then, clasping the precious cup tightly in his arms, hesprang to the opening of the Knowe, through which he could see the starsglimmering clearly.He was just in time, for it fell to with a crash behind him; and soon hewas speeding along the wet, dew-spangled moor, with the whole troop ofFairies at his heels. They were wild with rage, and from the shrillshouts of fury which they uttered, the page knew well that, if theyovertook him, he need expect no mercy at their hands.And his heart began to sink, for, fleet of foot though he was, he was nomatch for the Fairy Folk, who gained on him steadily."
9,"All seemed lost, when a mysterious voice sounded out of the darkness:    ""If you would gain the Castle door,    Keep to the black stones on the shore.""It was the voice of some poor mortal, who, for some reason or other, hadbeen taken prisoner by the Fairies--who were really very maliciousLittle Folk--and who did not want a like fate to befall the adventurouspage-boy; but the little fellow did not know this.He had once heard that if anyone walked on the wet sands, where thewaves had come over them, the Fairies could not touch him, and thismysterious sentence brought the saying into his mind."
10,"So he turned, and dashed panting down to the shore. His feet sank in thedry sand, his breath came in little gasps, and he felt as if he mustgive up the struggle; but he persevered, and at last, just as theforemost Fairies were about to lay hands on him, he jumped across thewater-mark on to the firm, wet sand, from which the waves had justreceded, and then he knew that he was safe.For the Little Folk could go no step further, but stood on the dry sanduttering cries of rage and disappointment, while the triumphant page-boyran safely along the shore, his precious cup in his arms, and climbedlightly up the steps in the rock and disappeared through the postern.And for many years after, long after the little page-boy had grown upand become a stately butler, who trained other little page-boys tofollow in his footsteps, the beautiful cup remained in the Castle as awitness of his adventure."
