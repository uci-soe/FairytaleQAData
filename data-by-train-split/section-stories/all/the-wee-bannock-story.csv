1,"""Some tell about their sweethearts,      How they tirled them to the winnock,    But I'll tell you a bonnie tale      About a guid oatmeal bannock."""
2,"There was once an old man and his wife, who lived in a dear littlecottage by the side of a burn. They were a very canty and contentedcouple, for they had enough to live on, and enough to do. Indeed, they considered themselves quite rich, for, besides their cottage and their garden, they possessed two sleek cows, five hens and a cock, an old cat, and two kittens.The old man spent his time looking after the cows, and the hens, and the garden; while the old woman kept herself busy spinning.One day, just after breakfast, the old woman thought that she would like an oatmeal bannock for her supper that evening, so she took down her bakeboard, and put on her girdle, and baked a couple of fine cakes, and when they were ready she put them down before the fire to harden."
3,"While they were toasting, her husband came in from the byre, and sat down to take a rest in his great arm-chair. Presently his eyes fell on the bannocks, and, as they looked very good, he broke one through the middle and began to eat it.When the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate, so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could. And when the old woman saw it disappearing, she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her, holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other.But she was old, and the bannock was young, and it ran faster than she did, and escaped over the hill behind the house. It ran, and it ran, and it ran, until it came to a large newly thatched cottage, and, as thedoor was open, it took refuge inside, and ran right across the floor toa blazing fire, which was burning in the first room that it came to."
4,"Now, it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor, and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross-legged on the top of a big table by the window, sewing away with all their might, while the tailor's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint.When the wee bannock came trundling across the floor, all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the Master Tailor's wife.""Hoot,"" she said, ""what a set of cowards ye be! It is but a nice weebannock. Get hold of it and divide it between you, and I'll fetch youall a drink of milk."""
5,"So she jumped up with her lint and her lint cards, and the tailor jumped up with his great shears, and one apprentice grasped the line measure, while another took up the saucer full of pins; and they all tried to catch the wee bannock. But it dodged them round and round the fire, and at last it got safely out of the door and ran down the road, with one of the apprentices after it, who tried to snip it in two with his shears.It ran too quickly for him, however, and at last he stopped and wentback to the house, while the wee bannock ran on until it came to a tiny cottage by the roadside. It trundled in at the door, and there was a weaver sitting at his loom, with his wife beside him, winding a clue of yarn."
6,"""What's that, Tibby?"" said the weaver, with a start as the little cakeflew past him.""Oh!"" cried she in delight, jumping to her feet, ""It is a wee bannock. I wonder where it came from?""""Dinna bother your head about that, Tibby,"" said her man, ""but grip it, my woman, grip it."""
7,"But it was not so easy to get hold of the wee bannock. It was in vainthat the Goodwife threw her clue at it, and that the Goodman tried to chase it into a corner and knock it down with his shuttle. It dodged, and turned, and twisted, like a thing bewitched, till at last it flew out at the door again, and vanished down the hill, ""for all the world,"" as the old woman said, ""like a new tarred sheep, or a daft cow.""In the next house that it came to it found the Goodwife in the kitchen, kirning. She had just filled her kirn, and there was still some creamstanding in the bottom of her cream jar.""Come away, little bannock,"" she cried when she saw it. ""Thou art come in just the nick of time, for I am beginning to feel hungry, and I'll have cakes and cream for my dinner."""
8,"But the wee bannock hopped round to the other side of the kirn, and the Goodwife after it. And she was in such a hurry that she nearly upset the kirn; and by the time that she had put it right again, the wee bannock was out at the door and half-way down the brae to the mill.The miller was sifting meal in the trough, but he straightened himselfup when he saw the little cake.""It's a sign of plenty when bannocks are running about with no one to look after them,"" he said; ""but I like bannocks and cheese, so just come in, and I will give thee a night's lodging."""
9,"But the little bannock had no wish to be eaten up by the miller, so it turned and ran out of the mill, and the miller was so busy that he did not trouble himself to run after it.After this it ran on, and on, and on, till it came to the smithy, andit popped in there to see what it could see.The smith was busy at the anvil making horse-shoe nails, but he looked up as the wee bannock entered."
10,"""If there be one thing I am fond of, it is a glass of ale and awell-toasted cake,"" he cried. ""So come inside here, and welcome to you.""But as soon as the little bannock heard of the ale, it turned and ranout of the smithy as fast as it could, and the disappointed smith pickedup his hammer and ran after it. And when he saw that he could not catchit, he flung his heavy hammer at it, in the hope of knocking it down,but, luckily for the little cake, he missed his aim.After this the bannock came to a farmhouse, with a great stack of peatsstanding at the back of it. In it went, and ran to the fireside. In thishouse the master had all the lint spread out on the floor, and wascloving it with an iron rod, while the mistress was heckling what he had already cloven."
11,"""Oh, Janet,"" cried the Goodman in surprise, ""here comes in a littlebannock. It looks rare and good to eat. I'll have one half of it.""""And I'll have the other half,"" cried the Goodwife. ""Hit it over theback with your cloving-stick, Sandy, and knock it down. Quick, or itwill be out at the door again.""But the bannock played ""jook-about,"" and dodged behind a chair. ""Hoot!"" cried Janet contemptuously, for she thought that her husband might easily have hit it, and she threw her heckle at it.But the heckle missed it, just as her husband's cloving-rod had done, for it played ""jook-about"" again, and flew out of the house."
12,"This time it ran up a burnside till it came to a little cottage standingamong the heather.Here the Goodwife was making porridge for the supper in a pot over the fire, and her husband was sitting in a corner plaiting ropes of straw with which to tie up the cow.""Oh, Jock! come here, come here,"" cried the Goodwife. ""You are crying for a little bannock for your supper; come here, histie, quick, and help me to catch it.""""Ay, ay,"" assented Jock, jumping to his feet and hurrying across thelittle room. ""But where is it? I cannot see it.""""There, man, there,"" cried his wife, ""under that chair. Run thou to that side; I will keep to this."""
13,"So Jock ran into the dark corner behind the chair; but, in his hurry, he tripped and fell, and the wee bannock jumped over him and flew laughing out at the door.Through the whins and up the hillside it ran, and over the top of thehill, to a shepherd's cottage on the other side.The inmates were just sitting down to their porridge, and the Goodwife was scraping the pan.""Save us and help us,"" she exclaimed, stopping with the spoon half-way to her mouth. ""There's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at ourfireside.""""Sneck the door,"" cried the husband, ""and we'll try to catch it. Itwould come in handy after the porridge."""
14,"But the bannock did not wait until the door was sneckit. It turned andran as fast as it could, and the shepherd and his wife and all thebairns ran after it, with their spoons in their hands, in hopes ofcatching it.And when the shepherd saw that it could run faster than they could, he threw his bonnet at it, and almost struck it; but it escaped all these dangers, and soon it came to another house, where the folk were just going to bed.The Goodman was half undressed, and the Goodwife was raking the cinders carefully out of the fire."
15,"""What's that?"" said he, ""for the bowl of brose that I had at supper-time wasn't very big.""

""Catch it, then,"" answered his wife, ""and I'll have a bit, too. Quick!
quick! Throw your coat over it or it will be away.""

So the Goodman threw his coat right on the top of the little bannock,and almost managed to smother it; but it struggled bravely, and got out,breathless and hot, from under it. Then it ran out into the grey light again, for night was beginning to fall, and the Goodman ran out after it, without his coat. He chased it and chased it through the stackyard and across a field, and in amongst a fine patch of whins. Then he lost it; and, as he was feeling cold without his coat, he went home."
16,"As for the poor little bannock, it thought that it would creep under awhin bush and lie there till morning, but it was so dark that it neversaw that there was a fox's hole there. So it fell down the fox's hole,and the fox was very glad to see it, for he had had no food for twodays.""Oh, welcome, welcome,"" he cried; and he snapped it through the middle with his teeth, and that was the end of the poor wee bannock.And if a moral be wanted for this tale, here it is: That people shouldnever be too uplifted or too cast down over anything, for all the good folk in the story thought that they were going to get the bannock, and, lo and behold! the fox got it after all."
