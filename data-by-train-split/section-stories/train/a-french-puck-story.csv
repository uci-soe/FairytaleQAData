1,"Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France
there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit. It was this spirit's delight to play
tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys.
They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself
into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. Indeed,
there was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a
needle. At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as
he might he never was able to imitate the hole. Every woman would
have found him out at once, and this he knew.

Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will
call Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight. This was just when the
shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day's work, were sound
asleep. Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that
fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang
to the ground. The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the
cowboys, however fatigued they might be. They dragged themselves
wearily to the stable to put back the chains. But no sooner had they
returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on
till the morning. Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting
together the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take
the grooms hours of labour to get them right in the morning. Puck,
hidden among the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying
himself amazingly all the time."
2,"One evening more than eighty years ago a man named William was passing
along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating
loudly. William thought it must have strayed from the flock, and that he
had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner. So
he went up to where it was standing, and as it seemed so tired that it
could hardly walk, he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on
his way. The sheep was pretty heavy, but the good man was merciful and
staggered along as best he could under his load.

'It is not much further,' he thought to himself as he reached an avenue
of walnut trees, when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head, and
made him jump.

'Where are you?' said the voice, and the sheep answered:

'Here on the shoulders of a donkey.'

In another moment the sheep was standing on the ground and William was
running towards home as fast as his legs would carry him. But as he
went, a laugh, which yet was something of a bleat, rang in his ears.
Though he tried not to hear, the words reached him, 'Oh, dear! What fun
I have had, to be sure!'"
3,"Puck was careful not always to play his tricks in the same place, but
visited one village after another, so that everyone trembled lest he
should be the next victim. After a bit he grew tired of cowboys and
shepherds, and wondered if there was no one else to give him some sport.
At length he was told of a young couple who were going to the nearest
town to buy all that they needed for setting up house. Quite certain
that they would forget something which they could not do without, Puck
waited patiently till they were jogging along in their cart on their
return journey. He changed himself into a fly in order to overhear
their conversation.

For a long time it was very dull--all about their wedding day next
month, and who were to be invited. This led the bride to her wedding
dress, and she gave a little scream.

'Just think! Oh! how could I be so stupid! I have forgotten to buy the
different coloured reels of cotton to match my clothes!'

'Dear, dear!' exclaimed the young man. 'That is unlucky. Didn't you
tell me that the dressmaker was coming in to-morrow?'

'Yes, I did,' and then suddenly she gave another little scream, which
had quite a different sound from the first. 'Look! Look!'"
4,"The bridegroom looked, and on one side of the road he saw a large ball
of thread of all colours. All the colours, that is, of the dresses
that were tied on to the back of the cart.

'Well, that is a wonderful piece of good fortune,' cried he, as he
sprang out to get it. 'One would think a fairy had put it there on
purpose.'

'Perhaps she has,' laughed the girl. As she spoke she seemed to hear
an echo of her laughter coming from the horse, but of course that was
nonsense.

The dressmaker was delighted with the thread that was given her. It
matched the stuffs so perfectly, and never tied itself in knots, or
broke perpetually, as most thread did. She finished her work much
quicker than she expected and the bride said she was to be sure to come
to the church and see her in her wedding dress.

There was a great crowd assembled to witness the ceremony. The young
people were immense favourites in the neighbourhood, and their parents
were very rich. The doors were open, and the bride could be seen from
afar, walking under the chestnut avenue."
5,"'What a beautiful girl!' exclaimed the men. 'What a lovely dress!'
whispered the women. But just as she entered the church and took the
hand of the bridegroom, who was waiting for her, a loud noise was heard.

'Crick! crack! Crick! crack!' and the wedding garments fell to the
ground, to the great confusion of the wearer.

Not that the ceremony was put off for a little thing like that! Cloaks
in profusion were instantly offered to the young bride, but she was so
upset that she could hardly keep from tears. One of the guests, more
curious than the rest, stayed behind to examine the dress, determined,
if she could, to find out the cause of the disaster.

'The thread must have been rotten,' she said to herself. 'I will see if
I can break it.' But search as she would she could find none.

The thread had vanished!"
