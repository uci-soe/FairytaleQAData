1,"Morraha rose in the morning, and washed his hands and face, and said his
prayers, and ate his food. He asked God to prosper the day for him;
and he went down to the brink of the sea, and he saw a currach, short
and green, coming towards him. In it there was but one youthful
champion, and he playing hurly from prow to stern of the currach. He had
a hurl of gold and a ball of silver. He stopped not until the
currach was in on the shore. He drew her up on the green grass, and
put fastening on her for a day and a year, whether he should be there
all that time, or should only be on land for an hour by the clock. And
Morraha saluted the young man in words intelligent, intelligible, such
as were spoken at that time. The other saluted him in the same
fashion, and asked him would he play a game of cards with him; and
Morraha said he had not the wherewithal. The other answered that he
was never without a candle or the making of it. He put his hand in
his pocket and drew out a table and two chairs and a pack of cards, and
they sat down on the chairs and went to the card-playing. The first game
Morraha won, and the slender red champion bade him make his claim. He said that the land above him should be filled with stock of sheep in
the morning. It was well, and he played no second game, but home he
went.

The next day Morraha went to the brink of the sea, and the young man
came in the currach and asked him would he play cards. They played,
and Morraha won. And the young man bade him make his claim. He said
that the land above should be filled with cattle in the morning. It was
well, and he played no other game, but went home."
2,"And on the third morning Morraha went to the brink of the sea, and he
saw the young man coming. And he drew up his boat on the shore, and
asked him would he play cards. And they played, and Morraha won the
game. The young man bade him give his claim. And he said he should
have a castle, and of women the finest and fairest; and they were his.
It was well, and the young man went away.

On the fourth day the woman asked him how he had found himself, and he
told her. ""And I am going out,"" said he, ""to play again to-day.""

""I cross (forbid) you go again to him. If you have won so much, you
will lose more. Have no more to do with him.""

But he went against her will, and he saw the currach coming, and the
young man was driving his balls from end to end of the currach. He had
balls of silver and a hurl of gold, and he stopped not till he drew his
boat on the shore, and made her fast for a year and a day. And Morraha
and he saluted each other. He asked Morraha if he would play a game
of cards, and they played and he won. And Morraha said to him, ""Give
your claim, now.""

Said he, ""You will hear it too soon. I lay on you the bonds of the art
of the Druid not to sleep two nights in one house, nor finish a second
meal at the one table, till you bring me the sword of light and news of
the death of Anshgayliacht."""
3,"He went down to his wife, and sat down in a chair, and gave a groan, and
the chair broke in pieces.

""It is the son of a king under spells you are,"" said his wife, ""And you
had better have taken my counsel than that the spells should be on you.""
He said to her to bring news of the death of Anshgayliacht and the sword
of light to the slender red champion.

""Go out,"" said she, ""in the morning of the morrow, and take the bridle
in the window and shake it. Whatever beast, handsome or ugly, puts
the head in it, take that one with you. Do not speak a word to her till
she speaks to you. Take with you three pint bottles of ale and three
sixpenny loaves, and do the thing she tells you. When she runs to my
father's land, on a height above the court, she will shake herself, and
the bells will ring, and my father will say Brown Allree is in the land.
And if the son of a king or queen is there, bring him to me on your
shoulders. If it is the son of a poor man, let him come no further.""

He rose in the morning, and took the bridle that was in the window and
went out and shook it, and Brown Allree came and put her head in it. And
he took the three loaves and three bottles of ale, and went riding. When he was riding, she bent her head down to take hold of her feet with
her mouth, in hopes he would speak in ignorance. He spoke not a word
during the time, and the mare at last spoke to him, and said to him to
dismount and give her her dinner. He gave her the sixpenny loaf toasted
and a bottle of ale to drink. ""Sit up, now, riding and take good heed of
yourself: there are three miles of fire I have to clear at a leap."""
4,"She cleared the three miles of fire at a leap, and asked if he were
riding, and he said he was. They went on then, and she told him to
dismount and give her a meal. He did so, and gave her a sixpenny
loaf and a bottle. She consumed them, and said to him there were
before them three miles of hill covered with steel thistles, and that
she must clear it. And she cleared the hill with a leap, and she asked
him if he were still riding, and he said he was. They went on, and she
went not far before she told him to give her a meal, and he gave her the
bread and the bottleful. And she went over three miles of sea with a
leap, and she came then to the land of the King of France. She went
up on a height above the castle, and she shook herself and neighed, and
the bells rang. The King said that it was Brown Allree was in the
land. ""Go out,"" said he, ""and if it is the son of a king or queen, carry
him in on your shoulders; if it is not, leave him there.""

They went out, and the stars of the son of a king were on his breast;
and they lifted him high on their shoulders and bore him in to the King.
And they passed the night cheerfully with playing and with drinking,
with sport and with diversion, till the whiteness of the day came upon
the morrow morning.

Then the young King told the cause of his journey, and he asked of the
Queen her counsel and consent, and to give him counsel and good luck,
and the woman told him everything she advised him to do. ""Go now,"" said
she, ""and take with you the best mare in the stable, and go to the door
of Rough Niall of the speckled rock, and knock, and call on him to give
you news of the death of Anshgayliacht and the sword of light; and let
the horse's back be to the door, and apply the spurs, and away with
you!"""
5,"And in the morning he did so, and he took the best horse from the stable
and rode to the door of Niall, and turned the horse's back to the door,
and demanded news of the death of Anshgayliacht, and the sword of light. He applied the spurs, and away with him. And Niall followed him, and
as he was passing the gate cut the horse in two. And the mother was
there with a dish of puddings and flesh, and she threw it in his eyes
and blinded him, and said, ""Fool, whatever kind of man it is that's
mocking you, isn't that a fine condition you have got into on your
father's horse?""

On the morning of the next day Morraha rose and took another horse from
the stable, and went again to the door of Niall, and knocked and
demanded news of the death of Anshgayliacht, and the sword of light, and
applied the spurs to the horse, and away with him. And Niall followed,
and as he was passing the gate cut the horse in two, and took half the
saddle with him, and his mother met him, and threw the flesh in his eyes
and blinded him.

And on the third day Morraha went also to the door of Niall. Niall
followed him, and as he was passing the gate cut away the saddle from
under him and the clothes from his back. Then his mother said to Niall:

""Whatever fool it is that's mocking you, he is out yonder in the little
currach, going home; and take good heed to yourself, and don't sleep one
wink for three days.""

And for three days the little currach was there before him, and then his
mother came to him and said:

""Sleep as much as you want now. He is gone."""
6,"And he went to sleep, and there was heavy sleep on him, and Morraha went
in and took hold of the sword that was on the bed at his head. And the
sword thought to draw itself out of the hand of Morraha, but it failed.
And then it gave a cry, and it wakened Niall, and Niall said it was a
rude and rough thing to come into his house like that. Morraha said
to him:

""Leave your much talking, or I will cut the head off you. Tell me the
news of the death of Anshgayliacht.""

""Oh, you can have my head.""

""But your head is no good to me. Tell me the story.""

""Oh,"" said Niall's wife, ""you must get the story.""

""Oh,"" said Morraha, ""is the woman your wife?""

""Oh,"" said the man, ""is it not you that have the story?""

""Oh,"" said she, ""you will tell it to us.""

""Well,"" said the man, ""let us sit down together till I tell the story. I
thought no one would ever get it, but now it will be heard by all.""

When I was growing up my mother taught me the language of the birds, and
when I got married I used to be listening to their conversation. I
would be laughing, and my wife would be asking me what was the reason of
my laughing. I did not like to tell her, as women are always asking
questions. We went out walking one fine morning, and the birds were
arguing with one another. One of them said to another:

""Why should you be making comparison with me, when there is not a king
nor knight that does not come to look at my tree?"""
7,"""Oh, what advantage has your tree over mine, on which there are three
rods of magic and mastery growing?""

When I heard them arguing, and knew that the rods were there, I began to
laugh.

""Oh,"" said my wife, ""why are you always laughing? I believe it is at
myself you are jesting, and I'll walk with you no more.""

""Oh, it is not about you I am laughing. It is because I understand the
language of the birds.""

Then I had to tell her what the birds were saying to one another. She was greatly delighted, and she asked me to go home, and she gave
orders to the cook to have breakfast ready at six o'clock in the
morning. I did not know why she was going out early, and breakfast was
ready in the morning at the hour she appointed. She asked me to go out
walking. I went with her. She went to the tree, and asked me to cut a
rod for her.

""Oh, I will not cut it. Are we not better without it?""

""I will not leave this till I get the rod, to see if there is any good
in it.""

I cut the rod, and gave it to her. She turned from me, and struck a blow
on a stone and changed it. She struck a second blow on me, and made
of me a black raven, and she went home, and left me after her. I thought
she would come back. She did not come, and I had to go into a tree till
morning. In the morning, at six o'clock, there was a bellman out,
proclaiming that everyone who killed a raven would get a fourpenny bit.
At last you would not find man or boy without a gun, nor, if you were to
walk three miles, a raven that was not killed. I had to make a nest in
the top of the parlour chimney, and hide myself all day till night came,
and go out to pick up a bit to support me, till I spent a month. Here
she is herself (to say) if it is a lie I am telling.

""It is not,"" said she."
8,"Then I saw her out walking. I went up to her, and I thought she would
turn me back to my own shape, and she struck me with the rod and made of
me an old white horse. She ordered me to be put to a cart with a man
to draw stones from morning till night. I was worse off then. She
spread abroad a report that I had died suddenly in my bed, and prepared
a coffin, and waked me, and buried me. Then she had no trouble. But when
I got tired, I began to kill everyone who came near me, and I used to go
into the haggard every night and destroy the stacks of corn. When a
man came near me in the morning, I would follow him till I broke his
bones. Everyone got afraid of me. When she saw I was doing mischief, she
came to meet me, and I thought she would change me. And she did change
me, and made a fox of me. When I saw she was doing me every sort of
damage, I went away from her. I knew there was a badger's hole in the
garden, and I went there till night came, and I made great slaughter
among the ducks and geese. There she is herself to say if I am telling a
lie.

""Oh, you are telling nothing but the truth, only less than the truth.""

When she had enough of my killing the fowl, she came out into the
garden, for she knew I was in the badger's hole. She came to me, and
made me a wolf. I had to be off, and go to an island, where no one at
all would see me, and now and then I used to be killing sheep, for there
were not many of them, and I was afraid of being seen and hunted; and so
I passed a year, till a shepherd saw me among the sheep, and a pursuit
was made after me. And when the dogs came near me, there was no place
for me to escape to from them; but I recognised the sign of the King
among the men, and I made for him, and the King cried out to stop the
hounds. I took a leap upon the front of the King's saddle, and the woman
behind cried out, ""My King and my lord, kill him, or he will kill you."""
9,"""Oh, he will not kill me. He knew me; and must be pardoned.""

And the King took me home with him, and gave orders that I should be
well cared for. I was so wise when I got food I would not eat one morsel
until I got a knife and fork. The man told the King, and the King came
to see if it was true, and I got a knife and fork, and I took the knife
in one paw and the fork in the other, and I bowed to the King. The King
gave orders to bring him drink, and it came; and the King filled a glass
of wine, and gave it to me.

I took hold of it in my paw, and drank it, and thanked the King.

""Oh, on my honour, it is some king that has lost him when he came on the
island; and I will keep him, as he is trained. Perhaps he will
serve us yet.""

And this is the sort of King he was--a King who had not a child living.
Eight sons were born to him and three daughters, and they were stolen
the same night they were born. No matter what guard was placed over
them, the child would be gone in the morning. The Queen was now carrying
the twelfth child, and when she was lying-in, the King took me with him
to watch the baby. The women were not satisfied with me. ""Oh,"" said the
King, ""what was all your watching ever? One that was born to me I have
not; and I will leave this one in the dog's care, and he will not let it
go."""
10,"A coupling was put between me and the cradle, and when everyone went to
sleep I was watching till the person woke who attended in the daytime;
but I was there only two nights when, it was near the day, I saw the
hand coming down through the chimney, and the hand was so big that it
took round the child altogether, and thought to take him away. I caught
hold of the hand above the wrist, and, as I was fastened to the cradle,
I did not let go my hold till I cut the hand from the wrist, and there
was a howl from the person without. I laid the hand in the cradle with
the child, and, as I was tired, I fell asleep. When I awoke I had
neither child nor hand. I began to howl, and the King heard me, and
he cried out that something was wrong with me, and he sent servants to
see what was the matter with me, and when the messenger came he saw me
covered with blood, and he could not see the child. He went to the
King, and told him the child was not to be got. The King came, and saw
the cradle coloured with the blood, and he cried out, ""Where was the
child gone?"" and everyone said it was the dog had eaten it.

The King said, ""It is not: loose him, and he will get the pursuit
himself.""

When I was loosed, I found the scent of the blood till I came to a door
of the room in which the child was. I went to the King, and took hold of
him, and went back again, and began to tear at the door. The King
followed me, and asked for the key. The servant said it was in the room
of the stranger woman. The King caused search to be made for her, and
she was not to be found. ""I will break the door,"" said the King, ""as I
can't get the key."" The King broke the door, and I went in, and went to
the trunk, and the King asked for a key to unlock it. He got no key, and
he broke the lock. When he opened the trunk the child and the hand were
stretched side by side, and the child was asleep. The King took the
hand, and ordered a woman to come for the child, and he showed the hand
to everyone in the house. But the stranger woman was gone, and she did
not see the King; and here she is herself to say if I am telling lies of
her."
11,"""Oh, it's nothing but the truth you have.""

The King did not allow me to be tied any more. He said there was nothing
so much to wonder at as that I cut the hand off, and I tied.

The child was growing till he was a year old, and he was beginning to
walk, and there was no one caring for him more than I was. He was
growing till he was three, and he was running out every minute. So the
King ordered a silver chain to be put between me and the child, so that
he might not go away from me. I was out with him in the garden every
day, and the King was as proud as the world of the child. He would be
watching him every place we went, till the child grew so wise that he
would loose the chain and get off. But one day that he loosed it I
failed to find him. I ran into the house and searched the house, but
there was no getting him for me. The King cried to go out and find the
child, that he had got loose from the dog. They went searching for him,
but they could not find him. When they failed altogether to find him,
there remained no more favour with the King towards me, and everyone
disliked me, and I grew weak, for I did not get a morsel to eat half the
time. When summer came I said I would try and go home to my own country.
I went away one fine morning, and I went swimming, and God helped me
till I came home. I went into the garden, for I knew there was a place
in the garden where I could hide myself, for fear she should see me. In
the morning I saw my wife out walking, and my child with her, held by
the hand. I pushed out to see the child, and, as he was looking about
him everywhere, he saw me, and called out, ""I see my shaggy papa. Oh,""
said he; ""oh, my heart's love, my shaggy papa, come here till I see
you."""
12,"I was afraid the woman would see me, as she was asking the child where
he saw me, and he said I was up in a tree. The more the child called
me, the more I hid myself. The woman took the child home with her, but I
knew he would be up early in the morning.

I went to the parlour window, and the child was within, and he playing.
When he saw me, he cried out, ""Oh, my heart's love, come here till I see
you, shaggy papa."" I broke the window, and went in, and he began to kiss
me. I saw the rod in front of the chimney, and I jumped up at the rod
and knocked it down. ""Oh, my heart's love, no one would give me the
pretty rod."" I thought he would strike me with the rod, but he did not.
When I saw the time was short, I raised my paw, and I gave him a scratch
below the knee. ""Oh, you naughty, dirty, shaggy papa! You have hurt me
so much--I'll give yourself a blow of the rod."" He struck me a light
blow, and as there was no sin on him, I came back to my own shape again.
When he saw a man standing before him he gave a cry, and I took him up
in my arms. The servants heard the child. A maid came in to see what was
the matter with him. When she saw me she gave a cry out of her, and she
said, ""Oh, my soul to God, if the master isn't come to life again.""

Another came in, and said it was he, really. And when the mistress heard
of it, she came to see with her own eyes, for she would not believe I
was there. When she saw me she said she'd drown herself. And I said
to her, ""If you yourself will keep the secret, no living man will ever
get the story from me until I lose my head.""

Many's the man has come asking for the story, and I never let one
return; but now everyone will know it, but she is as much to blame as I.
I gave you my head on the spot, and a thousand welcomes, and she cannot
say I have been telling anything but the truth."
13,"""Oh, surely, nor are you now.""

When I saw I was in a man's shape I said I would take the child back to
his father and mother, as I knew the grief they were in after him. I
got a ship, and took the child with me. When I was journeying I came
to land on an island, and I saw not a living soul on it, only a court,
dark and gloomy. I went in to see was there anyone in it. There was no
one but an old hag, tall and frightful, and she asked me, ""What sort of
person are you?"" I heard someone groaning in another room, and I said I
was a doctor, and I asked her what ailed the person who was groaning.

""Oh,"" said she, ""it is my son, whose hand has been bitten from his wrist
by a dog.""

I knew then it was the boy who was taking the child from me, and I said
I would cure him if I got a good reward.

""I have nothing, but there are eight young lads and three young women,
as handsome as anyone laid eyes on, and if you cure him I will give you
them.""

""But tell me in what place his hand was cut from.""

""Oh, it was out in another country twelve years ago.""

""Show me the way, that I may see him.""

She brought me into a room, so that I saw him, and his arm was swelled
up to the shoulder. He asked if I would cure him. I said I could
cure him if he would give me the reward his mother promised.

""Oh, I will give it, but cure me.""

""Well, bring them out to me."""
14,"The hag brought them out of the room. I said I would burn the flesh that
was on his arm. When I looked on him he was howling with pain. I said
that I would not leave him in pain long. The thief had only one eye in
his forehead. I took a bar of iron, and put it in the fire till it was
red, and I said to the hag, ""He will be howling at first, but will fall
asleep presently, and do not wake him until he has slept as much as he
wants. I will close the door when I am going out."" I took the bar with
me, and I stood over him, and I turned it across through his eye as far
as I could. He began to bellow, and tried to catch me, but I was out and
away, having closed the door. The hag asked me, ""Why is he bellowing?""

""Oh, he will be quiet presently, and will sleep for a good while, and
I'll come again to have a look at him. Bring me out the young men
and the young women.""

I took them with me, and I said to her, ""Tell me where you got them.""

""Oh, my son brought them with him, and they are the offspring of the one
King.""

I was well satisfied, and I had no liking for delay to get myself free
from the hag, and I took them on board the ship, and the child I had
myself. I thought the King might leave me the child I nursed myself. But
when I came to land, and all those young people with me, the King and
Queen were out walking. The King was very aged, and the Queen aged
likewise. When I came to converse with them, and the twelve with me, the
King and Queen began to cry. I asked, ""Why are you crying?"""
15,"""Oh, it is for good cause I am crying. As many children as these I
should have, and now I am withered, grey, at the end of my life, and I
have not one at all.""

""Oh, belike, you will yet have plenty.""

I told him all I went through, and I gave him the child in his hand,
and: ""These are your other children who were stolen from you, whom I am
giving to you safe. They are gently reared.""

When the King heard who they were, he smothered them with kisses and
drowned them with tears, and dried them with fine cloths, silken, and
the hairs of his own head, and so also did their mother, and great was
his welcome for me, as it was I who found them all. And the King said to
me, ""I will give you your own child, as it is you who have earned him
best; but you must come to my court every year, and the child with you,
and I will share with you my possessions.""

""Oh, I have enough of my own, and after my death I will leave it to the
child.""

I spent a time till my visit was over, and I told the King all the
troubles I went through, only I said nothing about my wife. And now you
have the story of the death of Anshgayliacht, the hag's son.

And Morraha thanked Rough Niall for the story, and he struck the ground
with the Sword of Light, and Brown Allree was beside of him and she said
to him, ""Sit up, now, riding, and take good heed of yourself,"" and at
one leap she cleared the sea and at the next the three miles of hill
covered with steel thistles and at the third the three miles of fire,
and then he was home and he told the tale of the death of Anshgayliacht
to the Slender Red Champion and gave him the Sword of Light, and he was
well pleased to get them, and he took the spells of Morraha, and he had
his wife and his castle back again, and by-and-by the five children; but
he never put his hand to card-playing with strangers again."
