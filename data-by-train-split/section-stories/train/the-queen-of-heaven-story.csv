1,"The Queen of Heaven, who is also known as the Holy Mother, was inmortal life a maiden of Fukien, named Lin. She was pure, reverentialand pious in her ways and died at the age of seventeen. She shows herpower on the seas and for this reason the seamen worship her. Whenthey are unexpectedly attacked by wind and waves, they call on her andshe is always ready to hear their pleas."
2,"There are many seamen in Fukien, and every year people are lost atsea. And because of this, most likely, the Queen of Heaven took pityon the distress of her people during her lifetime on earth. And sinceher thoughts are uninterruptedly turned toward aiding the drowning intheir distress, she now appears frequently on the seas."
3,"In every ship that sails a picture of the Queen of Heaven hangs in thecabin, and three paper talismans are also kept on shipboard. On thefirst she is painted with crown and scepter, on the second as a maidenin ordinary dress, and on the third she is pictured with flowing hair,barefoot, standing with a sword in her hand. When the ship is indanger the first talisman is burnt, and help comes. But if this is ofno avail, then the second and finally the third picture is burned. Andif no help comes then there is nothing more to be done."
4,"When seamen lose their course among wind and waves and darklingclouds, they pray devoutly to the Queen of Heaven. Then a red lanternappears on the face of the waters. And if they follow the lantern theywill win safe out of all danger. The Queen of Heaven may often be seenstanding in the skies, dividing the wind with her sword. When she doesthis the wind departs for the North and South, and the waves growsmooth."
5,"A wooden wand is always kept before her holy picture in the cabin. Itoften happens that the fish-dragons play in the seas. They are twogiant fish who spout up water against one another till the sun in thesky is obscured, and the seas are shrouded in profound darkness. Andoften, in the distance, one may see a bright opening in the darkness.If the ship holds a course straight for this opening it will winthrough, and is suddenly floating in calm waters again. Looking back,one may see the two fishes still spouting water, and the ship willhave passed directly beneath their jaws. But a storm is always nearwhen the fish dragons swim; therefore it is well to burn paper or woolso that the dragons do not draw the ship down into the depths. Or theMaster of the Wand may burn incense before the wand in the cabin. Thenhe must take the wand and swing it over the water three times, in acircle. If he does so the dragons will draw in their tails anddisappear."
6,"When the ashes in the censer fly up into the air without any cause,and are scattered about, it is a sign that great danger isthreatening.Nearly two-hundred years ago an army was fitted out to subdue theisland of Formosa. The captain's banner had been dedicated with theblood of a white horse. Suddenly the Queen of Heaven appeared at thetip of the banner-staff. In another moment she had disappeared, butthe invasion was successful."
7,"On another occasion, in the days of Kien Lung, the minister DschouLing was ordered to install a new king in the Liu-Kiu Islands. Whenthe fleet was sailing by south of Korea, a storm arose, and his shipwas driven toward the Black Whirlpool. The water had the color of ink,sun and moon lost their radiance, and the word was passed about thatthe ship had been caught in the Black Whirlpool, from which no livingman had ever returned. The seaman and travelers awaited their end withlamentations. Suddenly an untold number of lights, like red lanterns,appeared on the surface of the water. Then the seamen were overjoyedand prayed in the cabins. ""Our lives are saved!"" they cried, ""the HolyMother has come to our aid!"" And truly, a beautiful maiden with goldenearrings appeared. She waved her hand in the air and the winds becamestill and the waves grew even. And it seemed as though the ship werebeing drawn along by a mighty hand. It moved plashing through thewaves, and suddenly it was beyond the limits of the Black Whirlpool."
8,"Dschou Ling on his return told of this happening, and begged thattemples be erected in honor of the Queen of Heaven, and that she beincluded in the list of the gods. And the emperor granted his prayer.Since then temples of the Queen of Heaven are to be found in allsea-port towns, and her birthday is celebrated on the eighth day ofthe fourth month with spectacles and sacrifices."
