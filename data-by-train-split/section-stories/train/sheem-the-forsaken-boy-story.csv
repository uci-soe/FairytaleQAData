1,"On a certain afternoon the sun was falling in the West, and in the midst
of the ruddy silence a solitary lodge stood on the banks of a remote
lake. One sound only broke, in the least degree, the forest
stillness. The low breathing of the dying inmate, who was the head of a
poor family. His wife and children surrounded the buffalo robe on which
he lay. Of the children, two were almost grown up--a daughter and a son. 
The other was a boy, and a mere child in years.

All the skill of the household in their simple medicines was exhausted. They stood looking on or moved about the lodge with whispered steps,
awaiting the departure of the spirit. As one of the last acts of
kindness, the skin door of the lodge had been thrown back to admit the
fresh air of the evening. The poor man felt a momentary return of
strength, and raising himself a little, he addressed his family.

""I leave you,"" he said, ""in a world of care, in which it has required
all my strength and skill to supply you food, and to protect you from
the storms and cold of a harsh climate."""
2,"He cast his eyes upon his wife, and continued:

""For you, my partner in life, I have less sorrow, because I am persuaded
you will not remain long behind me. But you, my children! My poor and
forsaken children, who have just begun the career of life, who will
shelter you from calamity? Listen to my words. Unkindness, ingratitude,
and every wickedness, are in the scene before you. It was for this that
years ago I withdrew from my kindred and my tribe to spend my days in
this lonely spot. I have contented myself with the company of your
mother and yourselves, during seasons of very frequent scarcity and
want. Your kindred, feasting in plenty, have caused the forests to
echo with the shouts of successful war. I gave up these things for the
enjoyment of peace. I wished to hide you away from the bad examples
which would have spoiled your innocence. I have seen you, thus far, grow
up in purity of heart. If we have sometimes suffered bodily want, we
have escaped pain of mind. We have not been compelled to look on or to
take a part with the red hand in scenes of rioting and bloodshed. My
path now stops. I have arrived at the brink of the world. I will shut my
eyes in peace if you, my children, will promise me to cherish each
other. Let not your mother suffer during the few days that are left to
her. I charge you, on no account, to forsake your younger brother.
Of him I give you both my dying command to have a tender care."""
3,"He spoke no more, and as the sun fell out of view the light had gone
from his face. The family stood still, as if they expected to hear
something further. But when they came to his side and called him by
name, his spirit did not answer. It was in another world.

The mother and daughter lamented aloud, but the elder son clothed
himself in silence, as though it had been a mantle. He took his course
as though nothing had occurred. He exerted himself to supply, with his
bow and net, the wants of the little household, but he never made
mention of his father.

Five moons had filled and waned, and the sixth was near its full, when
the mother also died. In her last moments she pressed the fulfillment of
their father's wish."
4,"The winter passed, and the spring, sparkling in the clear northern air,
cheered the spirits of the lonely little people in the lodge.

The girl, being the eldest, directed her brothers. She seemed to
feel a tender and sisterly affection for the youngest, who was slight in
frame and of a delicate temper. The other boy soon began to break forth
with restless speeches, which showed that his spirit was not at ease.
One day he addressed his sister as follows:

""My sister, are we always to live as if there were no other human beings
in the world? Must I deprive myself of the pleasure of mingling with my
own kind? I have determined this question for myself. I shall seek the
villages of men, and you can not prevent me."""
5,"The sister replied:

""I do not say no, my brother, to what you desire. We are not forbidden
the society of our fellow-mortals, but we are told to cherish each
other, and to do nothing that shall not be agreeable to all our little
household. Neither pleasure nor pain ought, therefore, to separate us,
especially from our younger brother, who, being but a child, and weakly
withal, is entitled to a double share of our affection. If we follow our
separate fancies, it will surely make us neglect him, whom we are bound
by vows, both to our father and mother, to support.""

The young man received this address in silence, and still took his
course as though nothing out of the ordinary way had occurred. After
awhile he seemed to recover his spirits. As they lived in a large
country, where there were open fields, the two brothers, at his
invitation, often amused themselves in playing ball. One afternoon he
chose the ground near to a beautiful lake, and they played and laughed
with great spirit. The ball was seldom allowed to touch the ground."
6,"Now in this lake there happened to harbor a wicked old Manito, Mishosha
by name, who looked at the brothers as they played. He was vastly
pleased with their nimbleness and beauty. He thought to himself, what
shall I do to get these lads to accompany me? One of them shall hit the
ball sideways, and it shall fall into my canoe.

It so happened, and it somehow seemed as if Owasso, the elder brother,
had purposely given it that direction. When Owasso saw the old man, he
professed to be greatly surprised. As was the other, Sheem by name, in
truth, for he had not noticed the old Manito before.

""Bring the ball to us,"" they both cried out. ""Come to the shore.""

""No,"" answered the old magician. He, however, came near enough for
either of them to wade out to him. ""Come, come,"" he said. ""Come and get
your ball.""

They insisted that he should come ashore, but he sturdily declined to
oblige them."
7,"""Very well,"" said Owasso, ""I will go and get it."" And he ran into the
water. ""Hand it to me,"" he said, when he had approached near enough to
receive it.

""Ha!"" answered the Manito, ""reach over and get it yourself.""

Owasso was about to grasp the ball, when the old magician suddenly
seized him and pushed him into the boat.

""My grandfather,"" said Owasso, ""pray take my little brother also. Alone
I can not go with you. He will starve if I leave him.""

Mishosha only laughed at him. Then uttering the charmed words, ""Chemaun
Poll!"" and giving his canoe a slap, it glided through the water, without
further help, with the swiftness of an arrow.

In a short time they reached the magician's lodge, which stood upon the
further shore, a little distance back from the lake. The two daughters
of Mishosha were seated within. ""My daughter,"" he said to his eldest, as
they entered the lodge, ""I have brought you a husband."""
8,"The young woman smiled. Owasso was a comely youth to look upon. The
magician told him to take his seat near her. By this act the
marriage ceremony was completed, and Owasso and the magician's daughter
were man and wife. In the course of time they had born to them a
son.

But no sooner was Owasso in the family than the old Manito wished him
out of the way. He went about in his own wicked fashion to compass
it.

One day he asked his son-in-law to go out a-fishing with him. They
started without delay. The magician had only to speak, and off went
the canoe. They reached a solitary bay in an island, a very dark,
lonely, and out-of-the-way place. The Manito advised Owasso to spear a
large sturgeon which came alongside, and with its great glassy eye
turned up, seemed to recognize the magician. Owasso rose in the boat to
dart his spear, and by speaking that moment to his canoe, Mishosha shot
forward and hurled his son-in-law headlong into the water. Leaving him to struggle for himself, he was soon out of sight."
9,"Owasso, being himself gifted with limited magical powers, spoke to the
fish, and bade him swim toward the lodge, while he carried him along,
which he did at great speed. Once he directed the sturgeon to rise near
the surface of the water, so that he might, if possible, get a view of
the magician. The fish obeyed, and Owasso saw the wicked old Manito busy
in another direction, fishing, as unconcerned as though he had not just
lost a member of his family.

On went the fish, and on went Owasso, till they reached the shore, near
the magician's lodge, in advance of him. He then spoke kindly to the
sturgeon, and told him he should not be angry with him for having
speared him, as he was created to be meat for man. The sturgeon made no
reply, or if he did, it has not been reported. Owasso, drawing him
on shore, went up and told his wife to dress and cook it immediately. By
the time it was prepared the magician had come in sight.

""Your grandfather has arrived,"" said the woman to her son. ""Go and see
what he brings, and eat this as you go""--handing a piece of the fish.

The boy went, and the magician no sooner saw him with the fish in his
hand, than he asked him, ""What are you eating? and who brought it?"""
10,"He replied, ""My father brought it.""

The magician began to feel uneasy, for he found that he had been
outwitted. He, however, put on a grave face, and entering the lodge,
acted as if nothing unusual had happened.

Some days after this, Mishosha again requested his son-in-law to
accompany him. Owasso, without hesitation, said ""Yes!""

They went out, and, in a rapid passage, they arrived at a solitary
island, which was no more than a heap of high and craggy rocks.

The magician said to Owasso, ""Go on shore, my son, and pick up all the
gulls' eggs you can find.""

The rocks were strewn with eggs, and the air resounded with the cry of
the birds as they saw them gathered up by Owasso.

The old magician took the opportunity to speak to the gulls. ""I have
long wished,"" he said, ""to offer you something. I now give you this
young man for food.""

He then uttered the charm to his canoe, and it shot out of sight,
leaving Owasso to make his peace the best way he could."
11,"The gulls flew in immense numbers around him, and were ready to devour
him. Owasso did not lose his presence of mind, but he addressed them and
said:

""Gulls, you know you were not formed to eat human flesh, nor was man
made to be the prey of birds. Obey my words. Fly close together, a
sufficient number of you, and carry me on your backs to the magician's
lodge.""

They listened attentively to what he said, and seeing nothing
unreasonable in his request, they obeyed him. Owasso soon found
himself sailing through the air swiftly homeward.

Meanwhile, it appears that the old magician had fallen asleep and
allowed his canoe to come to a stand-still. Owasso, in his flight
over the lake, saw him lying on his back in the boat, taking a nap,
which was quite natural, as the day was very soft and balmy."
12,"As Owasso, with his convoy of birds, passed over, he let fall, directly
in the face of the old magician, a capful of gulls' eggs. They broke
and so besmeared his eyes that he could barely see. He jumped up and
exclaimed:

""It is always so with these thoughtless birds. They never consider where
they drop their eggs.""

Owasso had flown on and reached the lodge in safety, and, excusing
himself for the liberty, he killed two or three of the gulls for the
sake of their feathers to ornament his son's head.

When the magician arrived, soon after, his grandson came out to meet
him, tossing his head about as the feathers danced and struggled with
the wind.

""Where did you get these?"" asked the Manito, ""and who brought them?""

""My father brought them,"" the boy replied.

The old magician was quite distressed in his mind that he had not
destroyed his son-in-law. He entered his lodge in silence, and set his
wits busily at work again to contrive some plan for easing his feelings
in that respect."
13,"He could not help saying to himself:

""What manner of boy is this who is ever escaping from my power? But his
guardian spirit shall not save him. I will entrap him to-morrow. Ha, ha,
ha!""

He was painfully aware that he had tried two of his charms without
effect, and that he had but two more left. He now professed to be more
friendly with his son-in-law than ever, and the very next day he said to
Owasso:

""Come, my son, you must go with me to procure some young eagles. We
will tame them, and have them for pets about the lodge. I have
discovered an island where they are in great abundance.""

They started on the trip. When, after traversing an immense waste of
water, they had reached the island, Mishosha led him inland until they
came to the foot of a tall pine-tree, upon which the nests were to be
found.

""Now, my son,"" said Mishosha, ""climb up this tree and bring down the
birds. I think you will get some fine ones up there.""

Owasso obeyed. When he had with great difficulty got near the nest,
Mishosha cried out, addressing himself to the tree, and without much
regard to the wishes of Owasso:

""Now stretch yourself up and be very tall."""
14,"The tree, at this bidding, rose up so far that Owasso would have
imperiled his neck by any attempt to get to the ground.

""Listen, ye eagles!"" continued Mishosha. ""You have long expected a gift
from me. I now present you this boy, who has had the presumption to
climb up where you are to molest your young. Stretch forth your claws
and seize him.""

So saying, the old magician, according to his custom in such cases,
turned his back upon Owasso. Going off in his canoe at a word, he
left his son-in-law to shift for himself.

But the birds did not seem to be so badly-minded as the old magician had
supposed. a very old bald eagle, quite corpulent and large of limb,
alighting on a branch just opposite, opened conversation with him by
asking what had brought him there.

Owasso replied that he had not mounted the tree of himself, or out of
any disposition to harm his people. his father-in-law, the old
magician who had just left them, had sent him up. He was constantly
sending him on mischievous errands. In a word, the young man was
enlarging at great length upon the character of the wicked Manito. He was interrupted by being darted upon by a hungry-eyed bird, with long
claws.

Owasso, not in the least disconcerted, boldly seized this fierce eagle
by the neck and dashed it against the rocks, crying out:

""Thus will I deal with all who come near me."""
15,"The old eagle, who appeared to be the head of the tribe, was so pleased
with this show of spirit that he immediately appointed two tall birds,
uncommonly strong in the wings, to transport Owasso to his lodge. They
were to take turns in conducting him through the air.

Owasso expressed many obligations to the old eagle for his kindness, and
they forthwith set out. It was a high point from which they started, for
the pine-tree had shot far, far up toward the clouds, and they could
even descry the enchanted island where the old magician lived, though it
was miles and miles away. For this point they steered their flight. In a short time they landed Owasso at the door of the lodge.

With many compliments for their dispatch, Owasso dismissed the birds,
and stood ready to greet his wicked father-in-law who now arrived. When he espied his son-in-law still unharmed, Mishosha grew very black
in the face. He had but a single charm left."
16,"He thought he would ponder deeply how he could employ that to the best
advantage. It happened that while he was doing so, one evening, as
Owasso and his wife were sitting on the banks of the lake, and the soft
breeze swept over it, they heard a song, as if sung by some one at a
great distance. The sound continued for some time, and then died away in
perfect stillness. ""Oh, it is the voice of Sheem,"" cried Owasso. ""It is
the voice of my brother! If I could but only see him!"" And he hung down
his head in deep anguish.

His wife witnessed his distress, and to comfort him she proposed that
they should attempt to make their escape, and carry him succor on the
morrow.

When the morning came, and the sun shone warmly into the lodge, the wife
of Owasso offered to comb her father's hair, with the hope that it
would soothe him to sleep. It had that effect. They no sooner saw
him in deep slumber than they seized the magic canoe, Owasso uttered the
charmed words, ""Chemaun Poll!"" and they glided away upon the water
without need of oar or sail."
17,"They had nearly reached the land on the opposite side of the lake, and
could distinctly hear the voice of the younger brother singing his
lament as before, when the old magician wakened. Missing his daughter
and her husband, he suspected deception of some kind. He looked for his
magic boat and found it gone. He spoke the magic words, which were more
powerful from him than from any other person in the world, and the canoe
immediately returned; to the sore disappointment of Owasso and his wife.

When they came back to the shore, Mishosha stood upon the beach and drew
up his canoe. He did not utter a word. The son-in-law and daughter
entered the lodge in silence.

The time, walking along in its broad open path, brought the autumn
months to a close, and the winter had set in. Soon after the first fall
of snow, Owasso said:

""Father, I wish to try my skill in hunting. It is said there is plenty
of game not far off, and it can now be easily tracked. Let us go."""
18,"The magician consented. They set out, and arriving at a good ground for
their sport, they spent the day in hunting. Night coming on, they built
themselves a lodge of pine-branches to sleep in. Although it was
bitterly cold, the young man took off his leggings and moccasins, and
hung them up to dry. The old magician did the same, carefully hanging
his own in a separate place, and they lay down to sleep.

Owasso, from a glance he had given, suspected that the magician had a
mind to play him a trick. To be ahead of  him, he watched an
opportunity to get up and change the moccasins and leggings, putting his
own in the place of Mishosha's, and depending on the darkness of the
lodge to help him through.

Near daylight, the old magician bestirred himself, as if to rekindle the
fire. He slyly reached down a pair of moccasins and leggings with a
stick, and thinking they were no other than those of Owasso's, he
dropped them into the flames. He cast himself down, and affected
to be lost in a heavy sleep. The leather leggings and moccasins soon
drew up and were burned."
19,"Instantly jumping up and rubbing his eyes, Mishosha cried out:

""Son-in-law, your moccasins are burning. I know it by the smell.""

Owasso rose up, deliberately and unconcerned.

""No, my friend,"" said he, ""here are mine,"" at the same time taking them
down and drawing them on. ""It is your moccasins that are burning.""

Mishosha dropped his head upon his breast. All his tricks were played
out--there was not so much as half a one left to help him out of the
sorry plight he was in.

""I believe, my grandfather,"" added Owasso, ""that this is the moon in
which fire attracts. I fear you must have set your foot and leg
garments too near the fire, and they have been drawn in. Now let us go
forth to the hunt.""

The old magician was compelled to follow him, and they pushed out into a
great storm of snow, and hail, and wind, which had come on over night.
Neither the wind, the hail, nor the snow, had the slightest respect
for the bare limbs of the old magician, for there was not the least
virtue of magic in those parts of old Mishosha's body. After a while
they quite stiffened under him, his body became hard, and the hair
bristled in the cold wind, so that he looked to Owasso--who turned away
from him, leaving the wicked old magician alone to ponder upon his past
life. To Owasso he looked like a tough old sycamore-tree more than a
highly-gifted old magician."
20,"Owasso himself reached home in safety, proof against all kinds of
weather, and the magic canoe became the exclusive property of the young
man and his wife.

During all this part of Owasso's stay at the lodge of Mishosha, his
sister, whom he had left on the main land with Sheem, their younger
brother, had labored with good-will to supply the lodge. She knew enough
of the arts of the forest to provide their daily food. She watched
her little brother, and tended his wants, with all of a good sister's
care. By times she began to be weary of solitude and of her charge. No
one came to be a witness of her constancy, or to let fall a single word
in her mother-tongue. She could not converse with the birds and beasts
about her, and she felt, to the bottom of her heart, that she was alone.
In these thoughts she forgot her younger brother. She almost wished him
dead; for it was he alone that kept her from seeking the companionship
of others.

One day, after collecting all the provisions she had been able to
reserve from their daily use, and bringing a supply of wood to the door,
she said to her little brother:

""My brother, you must not stray from the lodge. I am going to seek our
elder brother. I shall be back soon."""
21,"She then set the lodge in perfect order, and, taking her bundle, she set
off in search of habitations. These she soon found, and in the enjoyment
of the pleasures and pastimes of her new acquaintance, she began to
think less and less of her little brother, Sheem. She accepted proposals
of marriage, and from that time she utterly forgot the abandoned boy.

As for poor little Sheem, he was soon brought to the pinching turn of
his fate. As soon as he had eaten all of the food left in the lodge, he
was obliged to pick berries, and live off of such roots as he could dig
with his slender hands. As he wandered about in search of wherewithal to
stay his hunger, he often looked up to heaven, and saw the gray clouds
going up and down. And then he looked about upon the wide earth, but he
never saw sister nor brother returning from their long delay.

At last, even the roots and berries gave out. They were blighted by the
frost or hidden out of reach by the snow, for the mid-winter had come
on, and poor little Sheem was obliged to leave the lodge and wander away
in search of food."
22,"Sometimes he was enforced to pass the night in the clefts of old trees
or caverns, and to break his fast with the refuse meals of the savage
wolves.

These at last became his only resource, and he grew to be so little
fearful of these animals that he would sit by them while they devoured
their meat, and patiently await his share.

After a while, the wolves took to little Sheem very kindly, and seeming
to understand his outcast condition, they would always leave something
for him to eat. By and by they began to talk with him, and to inquire
into his history. When he told them that he had been forsaken by his
brother and his sister, the wolves turned about to each other, lifted up
their eyes to heaven, and wondered among themselves, with raised paws,
that such a thing should have been.

In this way, Sheem lived on till the spring, and as soon as the lake was
free from ice, he followed his new friends to the shore."
23,"It happened on the same day, that his elder brother, Owasso, was fishing
in his magic canoe, a considerable distance out upon the lake. He
thought he heard the cries of a child upon the shore. He wondered how
any human creature could exist on so bleak and barren a coast.

He listened again with all attention, and he heard the cry distinctly
repeated. This time it was the well-known cry of his younger brother
that reached his ear. He knew too well the secret of his song, as he
heard him chaunting mournfully:

""My brother! My brother! Since you left me going in the canoe, a-hee-ee,
I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee. I am half changed into a wolf,
E-wee.""

Owasso made for the shore, and as he approached the lament was repeated.
The sounds were very distinct, and the voice of wailing was very
sorrowful for Owasso to listen to. It touched him the more that it
died away at the close, into a long-drawn howl, like that of the wolf."
24,"In the sand, as he drew closer to the land, he saw the tracks as of that
animal fleeing away; and besides these the prints of human hands. But
what were the pity and astonishment that smote Owasso to the heart when
he espied his poor little brother--poor little forsaken Sheem--half boy
and half wolf, flying along the shore.

Owasso immediately leaped upon the ground and strove to catch him in his
arms, saying soothingly, ""My brother! my brother! Come to me.""

But the poor wolf-boy avoided his grasp, crying, as he fled, ""Neesia,
neesia. Since you left me going in the canoe, a-he-ee, I am half changed
into a wolf, E-wee. I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee!"" and howling
between these words of lament.

The elder brother, sore at heart, and feeling all of his brotherly
affection strongly returning, with renewed anguish, cried out, ""My
brother! my brother! my brother!""

But the nearer he approached to poor Sheem, the faster he fled, and the
more rapidly the change went on. The boy-wolf by turns singing and
howling, and calling out the name, first of his brother and then of his
sister, till the change was complete. He leaped upon a bank, and looking
back, and casting upon Owasso a glance of deep reproach and grief, he
exclaimed, ""I am a wolf!"" and disappeared in the woods."
