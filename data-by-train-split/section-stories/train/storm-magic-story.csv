1,"The cabin-boy had been traveling around all summer long with his
captain; but when they began to prepare to set sail in the fall, he grew
restless and did not want to go along. The captain liked him, for though
he was no more than a boy, he was quite at home on deck, was a big, tall
lad, and did not mind lending a hand when need arose; then, too, he did
as much work as an able seaman, and was so full of fun that he kept the
whole crew in good humor. And so the captain did not like to lose him.
But the youth said out and out that he was not minded to take to the
blue pond in the fall; though he was willing to stay on board till
the ship was loaded and ready to sail. One Sunday, while the crew was
ashore, and the captain had gone to a farm-holding near the forest, in
order to bargain for small timber and log wood--presumably on his own
account--for a deck load, the youth had been left to guard the ship.
But you must know that he was a Sunday child, and had found a four-leaf
clover; and that was the reason he had the second sight. He could see
those who are invisible, but they could not see him."
2,"And as he was sitting there in the forward cabin, he heard voices
within the ship. He peered through a crack, and there were three
coal-black crows sitting inside the deck-beams, and they were talking
about their husbands. All three were tired of them, and were planning
their death. One could see at once that they were witches, who had
assumed another form."
3,"""But is it certain that there is no one here who can overhear us?"" said
one of the crows. And by the way she spoke the cabin-boy knew her for
the captain's wife.

""No, you can see there's not,"" said the others, the wives of the first
and second quartermasters. ""There is not a soul aboard.""

""Well, then I do not mind saying that I know of a good way to get rid of
them,"" said the captain's wife once more, and hopped closer to the two
others. ""We will turn ourselves into breakers, wash them into the sea,
and sink the ship with every man on board."""
4,"That pleased the others, and they sat there a long time discussing the
day and the fairway. ""But is it certain that no one can overhear us?""
once more asked the captain's wife.

""You know that such is the case,"" said the two others.

""Well, there is a counter-spell for what we wish to do, and if it is
used, it will go hard with us, for it will cost us nothing less than our
lives!""

""What is the counter-spell, sister,"" asked the wife of the one
quartermaster.

""Is it certain that no one is listening to us? It seemed to me as though
some one were smoking in the forward cabin.""

""But you know we looked in every corner. They just forgot to let the
fire go out in the caboose, and that is why there's smoke,"" said the
quartermaster's wife, ""so tell away."""
5,"""If they buy three cords of birch-wood,"" said the witch,--""but it must
be full measure, and they must not bargain for it--and throw the first
cord into the water, billet by billet, when the first breaker strikes,
and the second cord, billet by billet, when the second breaker strikes,
and the third cord, billet by billet, when the third breaker strikes,
then it is all up with us!""

""Yes, that's true, sister, then it is all up with us! Then it is all up
with us!"" said the wives of the quartermasters; ""but there is no one who
knows it,"" they cried, and laughed loudly, and with that they flew out
of the hatchway, screaming and croaking like ravens."
6,"When it came time to sail, the cabin-boy would not go along for anything
in the world; and all the captain's coaxing, and all his promises were
useless, nothing would tempt him to go. At last they asked him whether
he were afraid, because fall was at hand, and said he would rather hide
behind the stove, hanging to mother's apron strings. No, said the youth,
he was not afraid, and they could not say that they had ever seen him
show a sign of so land-lubberly a thing as fear; and he was willing to
prove it to them, for now he was going along with them, but he made
it a condition that three cords of birch-wood were to be bought, full
measure, and that on a certain day he was to have command, just as
though he himself were the captain."
7,"The captain asked what sort of
nonsense this might be, and whether he had ever heard of a cabin-boy's
being entrusted with the command of a ship. But the boy answered that
was all one to him; if they did not care to buy the three cords of
birch-wood, and obey him, as though he were captain, for the space of a
single day--the captain and crew should know which day it was to be in
advance--then he would set foot on the ship no more, and far less would
he ever dirty his hands with pitch and tar on her again. The whole thing
seemed strange to the captain, yet he finally gave in, because he wanted
to have the boy along with him and, no doubt, he also thought that
he would come to his senses again when they were once under way. The
quartermaster was of the same opinion. ""Just let him command all he
likes, and if things go wrong with him, we'll help him out,"" said he. So
the birch-wood was bought, full-measure and without haggling, and they
set sail."
8,"When the day came on which the cabin-boy was to take command, the
weather was fair and quiet; but he drummed up the whole ship's crew, and
with the exception of a tiny bit of canvas, had all sails reefed. The
captain and crew laughed at him, and said: ""That shows the sort of a
captain we have now. Don't you want us to reef that last bit of sail
this very minute?"" ""Not yet,"" answered the cabin-boy, ""but before long.""

Suddenly a squall struck them, struck them so heavily that they thought
they would capsize, and had they not reefed the sails they would
undoubtedly have foundered when the first breaker roared down upon the
ship."
9,"The boy ordered them to throw the first cord of birch-wood overboard,
billet by billet, one at a time and never two, and he did not let them
touch the other two cords. Now they obeyed him to the letter, and did
not laugh; but cast out the birch-wood billet by billet. When the last
billet fell they heard a groaning, as though some one were wrestling
with death, and then the squall had passed.

""Heaven be praised!"" said the crew--and the captain added: ""I am going
to let the company know that you saved ship and cargo."""
10,"""That's all very well, but we are not through yet,"" said the boy, ""there
is worse to come,"" and he told them to reef every last rag, as well as
what had been left of the topsails. The second squall hit them with even
greater force than the first, and was so vicious and violent that the
whole crew was frightened. While it was at its worst, the boy told them
to throw overboard the second cord; and they threw it over billet by
billet, and took care not to take any from the third cord. When the last
billet fell, they again heard a deep groan, and then all was still. ""Now
there will be one more squall, and that will be the worst,"" said the
boy, and sent every one to his station. There was not a hawser loose on
the whole ship.

The last squall hit them with far more force than either of the
preceding ones, the ship laid over on her side so that they thought she
would not right herself again, and the breaker swept over the deck."
11,"But the boy told them to throw the last cord of wood overboard, billet
by billet, and no two billets at once. And when the last billet of wood
fell, they heard a deep groaning, as though some one were dying hard,
and when all was quiet once more, the whole sea was the color of blood,
as far as eye could reach.

When they reached land, the captain and the quartermasters spoke of
writing to their wives. ""That is something you might just as well let
be,"" said the cabin-boy, ""seeing that you no longer have any wives."""
12,"""What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! We have no wives?"" said the
captain. ""Or do you happen to have done away with them?"" asked the
quartermasters.

""No, all of us together did away with them,"" answered the boy, and told
them what he had heard and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on
watch on the ship; while the crew was ashore, and the captain was buying
his deckload of wood.

And when they sailed home they learned that their wives had disappeared
the day of the storm, and that since that time no one had seen or heard
anything more of them."
