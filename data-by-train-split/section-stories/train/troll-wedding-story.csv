1,"One summer, a long, long time ago, the folk of Melbustad went up to the
hill pastures with their herd. But they had been there only a short time
when the cattle began to grow so restless that it was impossible to keep
them in order. A number of different maidens tried to manage them, but
without avail; until one came who was betrothed, and whose betrothal had
but recently been celebrated. Then the cattle suddenly quieted down, and
were easy to handle. So the maiden remained alone in the hills with no
other company than a dog. And one afternoon as she sat in the hut, it
seemed to her that her sweetheart came, sat down beside her, and began
to talk about their getting married at once. But she sat still and made
no reply, for she noticed a strangeness about him. By and by, more and
more people came in. They began to cover the table with silverware,
and bring on dishes. The bridesmaids brought the bridal crown, and
the ornaments, and a handsome bridal gown. They dressed her, and put
the crown on her head, as was the custom in those days, and they put
rings on her hands."
2,"And it seemed to her as though she knew all the people who were there.
They were the women of the village, and the girls of her own age. But
the dog was well aware that there was something uncanny about it all.
He made his way down to Melbustad in flying leaps, and howled and barked
in the most lamentable manner, and gave the people no rest until they
followed him. The young fellow who was to marry the girl took his gun,
and climbed the hills. When he drew near, there stood a number of
horses around the hut, saddled and bridled. He crept up to the hut,
looked through a loop-hole in the wall, and saw a whole company sitting
together inside. It was quite evident that they were trolls, the people
from underground, and therefore he discharged his gun over the roof. At
that moment the doors flew open, and a number of balls of gray yarn, one
larger than the other, came shooting out about his legs. When he went
in, there sat the maiden in her bridal finery, and nothing was missing
but the ring on her little finger, then all would have been complete."
3,"""In heaven's name, what has happened here?"" he asked, as he looked
around. All the silverware was still on the table, but all the tasty
dishes had turned to moss and toadstools, and frogs and toads and the
like.

""What does it all mean?"" said he. ""You are sitting here in all your
glory, just like a bride?""

""How can you ask me?"" answered the maiden. ""You have been sitting here
yourself, and talking about our wedding the whole afternoon!""

""No, I have just come,"" said he. ""It must have been some one else who
had taken my shape!"""
4,"Then she gradually came to her senses. Not until long afterward was
she altogether herself, and she told how she had firmly believed that
her sweetheart himself, and all their friends and relatives had been
there. He took her straight back to the village with him, and so that
they need fear no such deviltry in the future, they celebrated their
wedding while she was still clad in the bridal outfit of the underground
folk. The crown and all the ornaments were hung up in Melbustad and it
is said that they hang there to this very day."
