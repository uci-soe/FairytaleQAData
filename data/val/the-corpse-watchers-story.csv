1,"There was once a poor woman that had three daughters, and one day the
eldest said, ""Mother, bake my cake and kill my cock till I go seek my
fortune."" So she did, and when all was ready, says her mother to her,
""Which will you have--half of these with my blessing, or the whole with
my curse?"" ""Curse or no curse,"" says she, ""the whole is little enough.""
So away she set, and if the mother didn't give her her curse, she didn't
give her her blessing.

She walked, and she walked, till she was tired and hungry, and then she
sat down to take her dinner. While she was eating it a poor woman came
up, and asked for a bit. ""The dickens a bit you'll get from me,"" says
she; ""it's all too little for myself."" And the poor woman walked away
very sorrowful. At nightfall she got lodging at a farmer's, and the
woman of the house told her that she'd give her a spadeful of gold and a
shovelful of silver if she'd only sit up and watch her son's corpse that
was waking in the next room. She said she'd do that, and so, when the
family were in their bed, she sat by the fire, and cast an eye from time
to time on the corpse that was lying under the table.

All at once the dead man got up in his shroud, and stood before her, and
said, ""All alone, fair maid?"" She gave him no answer; when he had said
it the third time he struck her with a switch, and she became a grey
flag."
2,"About a week after, the second daughter went to seek her fortune, and
she didn't care for her mother's blessing no more nor her sister, and
the very same thing happened to her. She was left a grey flag by the
side of the other.

At last the youngest went off in search of the other two, and she took
care to carry her mother's blessing with her. She shared her dinner with
the poor woman on the road, and she told her that she would watch over
her.

Well, she got lodging in the same place as the others, and agreed to
mind the corpse. She sat up by the fire, with the dog and cat, and
amused herself with some apples and nuts the mistress had given her. She
thought it a pity that the man under the table was a corpse, he was so
handsome."
3,"But at last he got up, and, says he, ""All alone, fair maid?"" and she
wasn't long about an answer:

  All alone I am not,
  I've little dog Douse, and Pussy, my cat;
  I've apples to roast and nuts to crack,
  And all alone I am not.

""Ho, ho!"" says he, ""you're a girl of courage, though you wouldn't have
enough to follow me. I am now going to cross the quaking bog, and go
through the burning forest. I must then enter the cave of terror and
climb the hill of glass, and drop from the top of it into the Dead Sea.""
""I'll follow you,"" says she, ""for I engaged to mind you."" He thought to
prevent her, but she was stiff as he was stout."
4,"Out he sprang through the window, and she followed him, till they came
to the ""Green Hills,"" and then says he:

  ""Open, open, Green Hills and let the light of the Green Hills through.""
  ""Aye,"" says the girl, ""and let the fair maid too.""

They opened, and the man and woman passed through, and there they were
on the edge of a bog.

He trod lightly over the shaky bits of moss and sod; and while she was
thinking of how she'd get across, the old beggar appeared to her, but
much nicer dressed, touched her shoes with a stick, and the soles spread
a foot on each side. So she easily got over the shaky marsh. The burning
wood was at the edge of the bog, and there the good fairy flung a damp,
thick cloak over her, and through the flames she went, and a hair of her
head was not singed."
5,"Then they passed through the dark cavern of
horrors, when she'd have heard the most horrible yells, only that the
fairy stopped her ears with wax. She saw frightful things, with blue
vapours round them, and felt the sharp rocks and the slimy backs of
frogs and snakes.

When they got out of the cavern, they were at the mountain of glass; and
then the fairy made her slippers so sticky with a tap of her rod that
she followed the young corpse quite easily to the top. There was the
deep sea a quarter of a mile under them, and so the corpse said to her,
""Go home to my mother, and tell her how far you came to do her bidding.
Farewell!"" He sprung head-foremost down into the sea, and after him she
plunged, without stopping a moment to think about it."
6,"She was stupefied at first, but when they reached the waters she
recovered her thoughts. After piercing down a great depth, they saw a
green light towards the bottom. At last they were below the sea, that
seemed a green sky above them; and, sitting in a beautiful meadow, she
half-asleep, and her head resting against his side. She couldn't keep
her eyes open, and she couldn't tell how long she slept; but when she
woke, she was in bed at his house, and he and his mother sitting by her
bedside, and watching her.

It was a witch that had a spite to the young man because he wouldn't
marry her, and so she got power to keep him in a state between life and
death till a young woman would rescue him by doing what she had done.
So, at her request, her sisters got their own shapes again, and were
sent back to their mother, with their spades of gold and shovels of
silver. Maybe they were better after that, but I doubt it much. The
youngest got the young gentleman for her husband. I'm sure she lived
happy, and, if they didn't live happy--that we may!"
