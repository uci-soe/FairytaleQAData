1,"Once upon a time, in the city of Shansi, there lived a scholar whofound the company of others too noisy for him. So he made his home ina Buddhist temple. Yet he suffered because there were always so manygnats and fleas in his room that he could not sleep at night."
2,"Once he was resting on his bed after dinner, when suddenly two littleknights with plumes in their helmets rode into the room. They mighthave been two inches high, and rode horses about the size ofgrasshoppers. On their gauntleted hands they held hunting falcons aslarge as flies. They rode about the room with great rapidity. Thescholar had no more than set eyes on them when a third entered, cladlike the others, but carrying a bow and arrows and leading a littlehunting dog the size of an ant with him."
3,"After him came a great throngof footmen and horsemen, several hundred in all. And they had huntingfalcons and hunting dogs by the hundred, too. Then the fleas and gnatsbegan to rise in the air; but were all slain by the falcons. And thehunting dogs climbed on the bed, and sniffed along the walls trailingthe fleas, and ate them up. They followed the trace of whatever hid inthe cracks, and nosed it out, so that in a short space of time theyhad killed nearly all the vermin."
4,"The scholar pretended to be asleep and watched them. And the falconssettled down on him, and the dogs crawled along his body. Shortlyafter came a man clad in yellow, wearing a king's crown, who climbedon an empty couch and seated himself there. And at once all thehorsemen rode up, descended from their horses and brought him all thebirds and game. They then gathered beside him in a great throng, andconversed with him in a strange tongue."
5,"Not long after the king got into a small chariot and his bodyguardssaddled their horses with the greatest rapidity. Then they gallopedout with great cries of homage, till it looked as though some one werescattering beans and a heavy cloud of dust rose behind them."
6,"They had nearly all of them disappeared, while the scholar's eyeswere still fixed on them full of terror and astonishment, and he couldnot imagine whence they had come. He slipped on his shoes and looked;but they had vanished without a trace. Then he returned and looked allabout his room; but there was nothing to be seen. Only, on a brickagainst the wall, they had forgotten a little hunting dog. The scholarquickly caught it and found it quite tame. He put it in his paint-boxand examined it closely. It had a very smooth, fine coat, and wore alittle collar around its neck."
7,"He tried to feed it a few bread-crumbs,but the little dog only sniffed at them and let them lie. Then itleaped into the bed and hunted up some nits and gnats in the folds ofthe linen, which it devoured. Then it returned and lay down. When thenight had passed the scholar feared it might have run away; but thereit lay, curled up as before. Whenever the scholar went to bed, the dogclimbed into it and bit to death any vermin it could find. Not a flyor gnat dared alight while it was around. The scholar loved it like ajewel of price."
8,"But once he took a nap in the daytime, and the little dog crawled intobed beside him. The scholar woke and turned around, supporting himselfon his side. As he did so he felt something, and feared it might behis little dog. He quickly rose and looked, but it was alreadydead--pressed flat, as though cut out of paper!But at any rate none of the vermin had survived it."
