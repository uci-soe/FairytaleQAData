1,"In the Kingdom of Fife, in the days of long ago, there lived an old manand his wife. The old man was a douce, quiet body, but the old woman waslightsome and flighty, and some of the neighbours were wont to look ather askance, and whisper to each other that they sorely feared that shewas a Witch.And her husband was afraid of it, too, for she had a curious habit ofdisappearing in the gloaming and staying out all night; and when shereturned in the morning she looked quite white and tired, as if she hadbeen travelling far, or working hard."
2,"He used to try and watch her carefully, in order to find out where shewent, or what she did, but he never managed to do so, for she alwaysslipped out of the door when he was not looking, and before he couldreach it to follow her, she had vanished utterly.At last, one day, when he could stand the uncertainty no longer, heasked her to tell him straight out whether she were a Witch or no. Andhis blood ran cold when, without the slightest hesitation, she answeredthat she was; and if he would promise not to let anyone know, the nexttime that she went on one of her midnight expeditions she would tell himall about it."
3,"The Goodman promised; for it seemed to him just as well that he shouldknow all about his wife's cantrips.He had not long to wait before he heard of them. For the very next weekthe moon was new, which is, as everybody knows, the time of all otherswhen Witches like to stir abroad; and on the first night of the new moonhis wife vanished. Nor did she return till daybreak next morning."
4,"And when he asked her where she had been, she told him, in great glee,how she and four like-minded companions had met at the old Kirk on themoor and had mounted branches of the green bay tree and stalks ofhemlock, which had instantly changed into horses, and how they hadridden, swift as the wind, over the country, hunting the foxes, and theweasels, and the owls; and how at last they had swam the Forth and cometo the top of Bell Lomond. And how there they had dismounted from theirhorses, and drunk beer that had been brewed in no earthly brewery, outof horn cups that had been fashioned by no mortal hands."
5,"And how, after that, a wee, wee man had jumped up from under a greatmossy stone, with a tiny set of bagpipes under his arm, and how he hadpiped such wonderful music, that, at the sound of it, the very troutsjumped out of the Loch below, and the stoats crept out of their holes,and the corby crows and the herons came and sat on the trees in thedarkness, to listen. And how all the Witches danced until they were soweary that, when the time came for them to mount their steeds again, ifthey would be home before cock-crow, they could scarce sit on them forfatigue."
6,"The Goodman listened to this long story in silence, shaking his headmeanwhile, and, when it was finished, all that he answered was: ""Andwhat the better are ye for all your dancing? Ye'd have been a deal morecomfortable at home.""At the next new moon the old wife went off again for the night; and whenshe returned in the morning she told her husband how, on this occasion,she and her friends had taken cockle-shells for boats, and had sailedaway over the stormy sea till they reached Norway. And there they hadmounted invisible horses of wind, and had ridden and ridden, overmountains and glens, and glaciers, till they reached the land of theLapps lying under its mantle of snow."
7,"And here all the Elves, and Fairies, and Mermaids of the North wereholding festival with Warlocks, and Brownies, and Pixies, and even thePhantom Hunters themselves, who are never looked upon by mortal eyes.And the Witches from Fife held festival with them, and danced, andfeasted, and sang with them, and, what was of more consequence, theylearned from them certain wonderful words, which, when they utteredthem, would bear them through the air, and would undo all bolts andbars, and so gain them admittance to any place soever where they wantedto be. And after that they had come home again, delighted with theknowledge which they had acquired.""What took you to such a land as that?"" asked the old man, with acontemptuous grunt. ""You would hae been a sight warmer in your bed."""
8,"But when his wife returned from her next adventure, he showed a littlemore interest in her doings.For she told him how she and her friends had met in the cottage of oneof their number, and how, having heard that the Lord Bishop of Carlislehad some very rare wine in his cellar, they had placed their feet on thecrook from which the pot hung, and had pronounced the magic words whichthey had learned from the Elves of Lappland. And, lo and behold! theyflew up the chimney like whiffs of smoke, and sailed through the airlike little wreathes of cloud, and in less time than it takes to tellthey landed at the Bishop's Palace at Carlisle."
9,"And the bolts and the bars flew loose before them, and they went down tohis cellar and sampled his wine, and were back in Fife, fine, sober, oldwomen by cock-crow.When he heard this, the old man started from his chair in right earnest,for he loved good wine above all things, and it was but seldom that itcame his way.""By my truth, but you are a wife to be proud of!"" he cried. ""Tell methe words, Woman! and I will e'en go and sample his Lordship's wine formyself."""
10,"But the Goodwife shook her head. ""Na, na! I cannot do that,"" she said,""for if I did, you telled it over again, it would turn the whole worldupside down. For everybody would be leaving their own lawful work, andflying about the world after other folk's business and other folk'sdainties. So just bide content, Goodman. You get on fine with theknowledge you already possess.""And although the old man tried to persuade her with all the soft wordshe could think of, she would not tell him her secret."
11,"But he was a sly old man, and the thought of the Bishop's wine gave himno rest. So night after night he went and hid in the old woman'scottage, in the hope that his wife and her friends would meet there; andalthough for a long time it was all in vain, at last his trouble wasrewarded. For one evening the whole five old women assembled, and in lowtones and with chuckles of laughter they recounted all that had befallenthem in Lappland. Then, running to the fireplace, they, one afteranother, climbed on a chair and put their feet on the sooty crook. Thenthey repeated the magic words, and, hey, presto! they were up the lumand away before the old man could draw his breath.""I can do that, too,"" he said to himself; and he crawled out of hishiding-place and ran to the fire. He put his foot on the crook andrepeated the words, and up the chimney he went, and flew through the airafter his wife and her companions, as if he had been a Warlock born."
12,"And, as Witches are not in the habit of looking over their shoulders,they never noticed that he was following them, until they reached theBishop's Palace and went down into his cellar, then, when they foundthat he was among them, they were not too well pleased.However, there was no help for it, and they settled down to enjoythemselves. They tapped this cask of wine, and they tapped that,drinking a little of each, but not too much; for they were cautious oldwomen, and they knew that if they wanted to get home before cock-crow itbehoved them to keep their heads clear.But the old man was not so wise, for he sipped, and he sipped, until atlast he became quite drowsy, and lay down on the floor and fell fastasleep."
13,"And his wife, seeing this, thought that she would teach him a lesson notto be so curious in the future. So, when she and her four friendsthought that it was time to be gone, she departed without waking him.He slept peacefully for some hours, until two of the Bishop's servants,coming down to the cellar to draw wine for their Master's table, almostfell over him in the darkness. Greatly astonished at his presence there,for the cellar door was fast locked, they dragged him up to the lightand shook him, and cuffed him, and asked him how he came to be there.And the poor old man was so confused at being awakened in this roughway, and his head seemed to whirl round so fast, that all he couldstammer out was, ""that he came from Fife, and that he had travelled onthe midnight wind."""
14,"As soon as they heard that, the men servants cried out that he was aWarlock, and they dragged him before the Bishop, and, as Bishops inthose days had a holy horror of Warlocks and Witches, he ordered him tobe burned alive.When the sentence was pronounced, you may be very sure that the poor oldman wished with all his heart that he had stayed quietly at home in bed,and never hankered after the Bishop's wine.But it was too late to wish that now, for the servants dragged him outinto the courtyard, and put a chain round his waist, and fastened it toa great iron stake, and they piled faggots of wood round his feet andset them alight."
15,"As the first tiny little tongue of flame crept up, the poor old manthought that his last hour had come. But when he thought that, he forgotcompletely that his wife was a Witch.For, just as the little tongue of flame began to singe hisbreeches, there was a swish and a flutter in the air, and a great GreyBird, with outstretched wings, appeared in the sky, and swooped downsuddenly, and perched for a moment on the old man's shoulder.And in this Grey Bird's mouth was a little red pirnie, which, toeveryone's amazement, it popped on to the prisoner's head. Then it gaveone fierce croak, and flew away again, but to the old man's ears thatcroak was the sweetest music that he had ever heard."
16,"For to him it was the croak of no earthly bird, but the voice of hiswife whispering words of magic to him. And when he heard them he jumpedfor joy, for he knew that they were words of deliverance, and he shoutedthem aloud, and his chains fell off, and he mounted in the air--up andup--while the onlookers watched him in awestruck silence.He flew right away to the Kingdom of Fife, without as much as sayinggood-bye to them; and when he found himself once more safely at home,you may be very sure that he never tried to find out his wife's secretsagain, but left her alone to her own devices."
