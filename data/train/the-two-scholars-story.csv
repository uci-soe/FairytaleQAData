1,"Once upon a time there were two scholars. One was named Liu Tschen andthe other Yuan Dschau. Both were young and handsome. One spring daythey went together into the hills of Tian Tai to gather curativeherbs. There they came to a little valley where peach-trees blossomedluxuriantly on either side. In the middle of the valley was a cave,where two maidens stood under the blossoming trees, one of them cladin red garments, the other in green. And they were beautiful beyondall telling. They beckoned to the scholars with their hands."
2,"""And have you come?"" they asked. ""We have been waiting for youoverlong!""Then they led them into the cave and served them with tea and wine.""I have been destined for the lord Liu,"" said the maiden in the redgown; ""and my sister is for the lord Yuan!"""
3,"And so they were married. Every day the two scholars gazed at theflowers or played chess so that they forgot the mundane worldcompletely. They only noticed that at times the peach-blossoms on thetrees before the cave opened, and at others that they fell from theboughs. And, at times, unexpectedly, they felt cold or warm, and hadto change the clothing they were wearing. And they marveled withinthemselves that it should be so."
4,"Then, one day, they were suddenly overcome by homesickness. Bothmaidens were already aware of it.""When our lords have once been seized with homesickness, then we mayhold them no longer,"" said they.On the following day they prepared a farewell banquet, gave thescholars magic wine to take along with them and said:""We will see one another again. Now go your way!""And the scholars bade them farewell with tears."
5,"When they reached home the gates and doors had long since vanished,and the people of the village were all strangers to them. They crowdedabout the scholars and asked who they might be.""We are Liu Tschen and Yuan Dschau. Only a few days ago we went intothe hills to pick herbs!""With that a servant came hastening up and looked at them. At last hefell at Liu Tschen's feet with great joy and cried: ""Yes, you arereally my master! Since you went away, and we had no news of any kindregarding you some seventy years or more have passed."""
6,"Thereupon he drew the scholar Liu through a high gateway, ornamentedwith bosses and a ring in a lion's mouth, as is the custom in thedwellings of those of high estate.And when he entered the hall, an old lady with white hair and bentback, leaning on a cane, came forward and asked: ""What man is this?""""Our master has returned again,"" replied the servant. And then,turning to Liu he added: ""That is the mistress. She is nearly ahundred years old, but fortunately is still strong and in goodhealth.""Tears of joy and sadness filled the old lady's eyes."
7,"""Since you went away among the immortals, I had thought that we shouldnever see each other again in this life,"" said she. ""What great goodfortune that you should have returned after all!""And before she had ended the whole family, men and women, camestreaming up and welcomed him in a great throng outside the hall.And his wife pointed out this one and that and said: ""That is so andso, and this is so and so!"""
8,"At the time the scholar had disappeared there had been only a tiny boyin his home, but a few years old. And he was now an old man of eighty.He had served the empire in a high office, and had already retired toenjoy his old age in the ancestral gardens. There were threegrand-children, all celebrated ministers; there were more than tengreat-grand-children, of whom five had already passed their examinationsfor the doctorate; there were some twenty great-great-grand-children, ofwhom the oldest had just returned home after having passed his inductionexaminations for the magistracy with honor. And the little ones, whowere carried in their parents' arms, were not to be counted."
9,"Thegrand-children, who were away, busy with their duties, all asked forleave and returned home when they heard that their ancestor hadreturned. And the girl grand-children, who had married into otherfamilies, also came. This filled Liu with joy, and he had a familybanquet prepared in the hall, and all his descendants, with their wivesand husbands sat about him in a circle. He himself and his wife, awhite-haired, wrinkled old lady, sat in their midst at the upper end.The scholar himself still looked like a youth of twenty years, so thatall the young people in the circle looked around and laughed."
10,"Then the scholar said: ""I have a means of driving away old age!""And he drew out his magic wine and gave his wife some of it to drink.And when she had taken three glasses, her white hair gradually turnedblack again, her wrinkles disappeared, and she sat beside her husband,a handsome young woman. Then his son and the older grand-childrencame up and all asked for a drink of the wine. And whichever of themdrank only so much as a drop of it was turned from an old man into ayouth. The tale was bruited abroad and came to the emperor's ears. Theemperor wanted to call Liu to his court, but he declined with manythanks. Yet he sent the emperor some of his magic wine as a gift. Thispleased the emperor greatly, and he gave Liu a tablet of honor, withthe inscription:    ""The Common Home of Five Generations""Besides this he sent him three signs which he had written with his ownimperial brush signifying:    ""Joy in longevity"""
11,"As to the other of the two scholars, Yuan Dschau, he was not sofortunate. When he came home he found that his wife and child had longsince died, and his grand-children and great-grand-children weremostly useless people. So he did not remain long, but returned to thehills. Yet Liu Tschen remained for some years with his family, thentaking his wife with him, went again to the Tai Hills and was seen nomore."
